Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a\\nsignificant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major\\napproach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving\\nfrom statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pre-\\ntraining Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various natural language processing (NLP)\\ntasks. Since the researchers have found that model scaling can lead to an improved model capacity, they further investigate the scaling\\neffect by increasing the parameter scale to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these\\nenlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement, but also exhibit some special abilities ( e.g., in-\\ncontext learning) that are not present in small-scale language models ( e.g., BERT). To discriminate the language models in different\\nparameter scales, the research community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant size ( e.g.,\\ncontaining tens or hundreds of billions of parameters). Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia\\nand industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT (a powerful AI chatbot developed based on LLMs), which has\\nattracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI\\ncommunity, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. Considering this rapid technical progress, in this\\nsurvey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular,\\nwe focus on four major aspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation. Furthermore, we\\nalso summarize the available resources for developing LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions. This survey provides\\nan up-to-date review of the literature on LLMs, which can be a useful resource for both researchers and engineers.\\nIndex Terms—Large Language Models; Emergent Abilities; Adaptation Tuning; Utilization; Alignment; Capacity Evaluation\\n✦\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\n“The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.”\\n—Ludwig Wittgenstein\\nL\\nANGUAGE is a prominent ability in human beings to\\nexpress and communicate, which develops in early\\nchildhood and evolves over a lifetime [3, 4]. Machines,\\nhowever, cannot naturally grasp the abilities of understand-\\ning and communicating in the form of human language,\\nunless equipped with powerful artificial intelligence (AI)\\nalgorithms. It has been a longstanding research challenge\\nto achieve this goal, to enable machines to read, write, and\\ncommunicate like humans [5].\\nTechnically, language modeling (LM) is one of the major\\napproaches to advancing language intelligence of machines.\\nIn general, LM aims to model the generative likelihood\\nof word sequences, so as to predict the probabilities of\\n• Version: v13 (major update on November 23, 2023).\\n• GitHub link: https://github.com/RUCAIBox/LLMSurvey\\n• Chinese version link: https://github.com/RUCAIBox/LLMSurvey/blob/\\nmain/assets/LLM Survey Chinese.pdf\\n• * K.

The research of LM has received\\nextensive attention in the literature, which can be divided\\ninto four major development stages:\\n• Statistical language models (SLM) . SLMs [6–9] are de-\\nveloped based on statistical learning methods that rose in\\nthe 1990s. The basic idea is to build the word prediction\\nmodel based on the Markov assumption, e.g., predicting the\\nnext word based on the most recent context. The SLMs with\\na fixed context length n are also called n-gram language\\nmodels, e.g., bigram and trigram language models. SLMs\\nhave been widely applied to enhance task performance\\nin information retrieval (IR) [10, 11] and natural language\\nprocessing (NLP) [12–14]. However, they often suffer from\\nthe curse of dimensionality: it is difficult to accurately\\nestimate high-order language models since an exponential\\nnumber of transition probabilities need to be estimated.\\nThus, specially designed smoothing strategies such as back-\\noff estimation [15] and Good–Turing estimation [16] have\\nbeen introduced to alleviate the data sparsity problem.\\n• Neural language models (NLM). NLMs [1, 17, 18] charac-\\nterize the probability of word sequences by neural networks,\\ne.g., multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs). As a remarkable contribution, the work in\\n[1] introduced the concept of distributed representation of\\nwords and built the word prediction function conditioned\\non the aggregated context features ( i.e., the distributed\\nword vectors).

A number of studies\\nhave explored the performance limit by training an ever\\nlarger PLM ( e.g., the 175B-parameter GPT-3 and the 540B-\\nparameter PaLM). Although scaling is mainly conducted\\nin model size (with similar architectures and pre-training\\ntasks), these large-sized PLMs display different behaviors\\nfrom smaller PLMs ( e.g., 330M-parameter BERT and 1.5B-\\nparameter GPT-2) and show surprising abilities (calledemer-\\ngent abilities [31]) in solving a series of complex tasks. For\\nexample, GPT-3 can solve few-shot tasks through in-context\\nlearning, whereas GPT-2 cannot do well. Thus, the research\\ncommunity coins the term “ large language models (LLM) ”1\\nfor these large-sized PLMs [32–35], which attract increasing\\nresearch attention (See Figure 1). A remarkable application\\nof LLMs is ChatGPT2 that adapts the LLMs from the GPT\\nseries for dialogue, which presents an amazing conversation\\nability with humans. We can observe a sharp increase of the\\narXiv papers that are related to LLMs after the release of\\nChatGPT in Figure 1.\\nAs discussed before, language model is not a new tech-\\nnical concept specially for LLMs, but has evolved with the\\nadvance of artificial intelligence over the decades. Early lan-\\nguage models mainly aim to model and generate text data,\\nwhile latest language models (e.g., GPT-4) focus on complex\\ntask solving. From language modeling to task solving, it is an\\nimportant leap in scientific thinking, which is the key to\\nunderstand the development of language models in the re-\\nsearch history. From the perspective of task solving, the four\\ngenerations of language models have exhibited different lev-\\nels of model capacities. In Figure 2, we describe the evolu-\\ntion process of language models in terms of the task solving\\ncapacity. At first, statistical language models mainly assisted\\nin some specific tasks ( e.g., retrieval or speech tasks), in\\nwhich the predicted or estimated probabilities can enhance\\nthe performance of task-specific approaches. Subsequently,\\nneural language models focused on learning task-agnostic\\nrepresentations (e.g., features), aiming to reduce the efforts\\nfor human feature engineering. Furthermore, pre-trained\\nlanguage models learned context-aware representations that\\ncan be optimized according to downstream tasks. For the\\nlatest generation of language model, LLMs are enhanced by\\nexploring the scaling effect on model capacity, which can be\\nconsidered as general-purpose task solvers. To summarize,\\nin the evolution process, the task scope that can be solved\\nby language models have been greatly extended, and the\\ntask performance attained by language models have been\\nsignificantly enhanced.\\nIn the existing literature, PLMs have been widely dis-\\ncussed and surveyed [36–39], while LLMs are seldom re-\\nviewed in a systematic way. To motivate our survey, we first\\nhighlight three major differences between LLMs and PLMs.\\nFirst, LLMs display some surprising emergent abilities that\\nmay not be observed in previous smaller PLMs. These abili-\\nties are key to the performance of language models on com-\\nplex tasks, making AI algorithms unprecedently powerful\\nand effective. Second, LLMs would revolutionize the way\\nthat humans develop and use AI algorithms. Unlike small\\n1. Note that a LLM is not necessarily more capable than a small PLM,\\nand emergent abilities may not occur in some LLMs.\\n2. https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/\\nPLMs, the major approach to accessing LLMs is through\\nthe prompting interface ( e.g., GPT-4 API). Humans have to\\nunderstand how LLMs work and format their tasks in a way\\nthat LLMs can follow. Third, the development of LLMs no\\nlonger draws a clear distinction between research and en-\\ngineering. The training of LLMs requires extensive practical\\nexperiences in large-scale data processing and distributed\\nparallel training. To develop capable LLMs, researchers\\nhave to solve complicated engineering issues, working with\\nengineers or being engineers.\\nNowadays, LLMs are posing a significant impact on\\nthe AI community, and the advent of ChatGPT and GPT-4\\nleads to the rethinking of the possibilities of artificial general\\nintelligence (AGI). OpenAI has published a technical article\\nentitled “ Planning for AGI and beyond ”, which discusses\\nthe short-term and long-term plans to approach AGI [40],\\nand a more recent paper has argued that GPT-4 might be\\nconsidered as an early version of an AGI system [41]. The\\nresearch areas of AI are being revolutionized by the rapid\\nprogress of LLMs. In the field of NLP , LLMs can serve as a\\ngeneral-purpose language task solver (to some extent), and\\nthe research paradigm has been shifting towards the use\\nof LLMs. In the field of IR, traditional search engines are\\nchallenged by the new information seeking way through AI\\nchatbots ( i.e., ChatGPT), and New Bing 3 presents an initial\\nattempt that enhances the search results based on LLMs. In\\nthe field of CV , the researchers try to develop ChatGPT-like\\nvision-language models that can better serve multimodal\\ndialogues [42–45], and GPT-4 [46] has supported multi-\\nmodal input by integrating the visual information. This new\\nwave of technology would potentially lead to a prosperous\\necosystem of real-world applications based on LLMs. For\\ninstance, Microsoft 365 is being empowered by LLMs ( i.e.,\\nCopilot) to automate the office work, and OpenAI supports\\nthe use of plugins in ChatGPT for implementing special\\nfunctions.\\nDespite the progress and impact, the underlying prin-\\nciples of LLMs are still not well explored. Firstly, it is\\nmysterious why emergent abilities occur in LLMs, instead of\\nsmaller PLMs. As a more general issue, there lacks a deep,\\ndetailed investigation of the key factors that contribute to\\nthe superior abilities of LLMs. It is important to study when\\nand how LLMs obtain such abilities [47]. Although there are\\nsome meaningful discussions about this problem [31, 47],\\nmore principled investigations are needed to uncover the\\n“secrets“ of LLMs. Secondly, it is difficult for the research\\ncommunity to train capable LLMs. Due to the huge de-\\nmand of computation resources, it is very costly to carry\\nout repetitive, ablating studies for investigating the effect\\nof various strategies for training LLMs. Indeed, LLMs are\\nmainly trained by industry, where many important training\\ndetails ( e.g., data collection and cleaning) are not revealed\\nto the public. Thirdly, it is challenging to align LLMs with\\nhuman values or preferences. Despite the capacities, LLMs\\nare also likely to produce toxic, fictitious, or harmful con-\\ntents. It requires effective and efficient control approaches\\nto eliminating the potential risk of the use of LLMs [46].\\nFaced with both opportunities and challenges, it needs\\nmore attention on the research and development of LLMs. In\\n3. https://www.bing.com/new'),\n",

LLMs exhibit strong capacities to un-\\nderstand natural language and solve complex tasks (via\\ntext generation). To have a quick understanding of how\\nLLMs work, this part introduces the basic background for\\nLLMs, including scaling laws, emergent abilities and key\\ntechniques.\\nFormulation of Scaling Laws for LLMs . Currently, LLMs\\nare mainly built upon the Transformer architecture [22],\\nwhere multi-head attention layers are stacked in a very\\ndeep neural network. Existing LLMs adopt similar Trans-\\nformer architectures and pre-training objectives ( e.g., lan-\\nguage modeling) as small language models. However, LLMs\\nsignificantly extend the model size, data size, and total\\n4. In existing literature, there is no formal consensus on the minimum\\nparameter scale for LLMs, since the model capacity is also related to\\ndata size and total compute. In this survey, we take a slightly loose\\ndefinition of LLMs, and mainly focus on discussing language models\\nwith a model size larger than 10B.\\ncompute (orders of magnification). Extensive research has\\nshown that scaling can largely improve the model capacity\\nof LLMs [26, 55, 56]. Thus, it is useful to establish a quantita-\\ntive approach to characterizing the scaling effect. Next, we\\nintroduce two representative scaling laws for Transformer\\nlanguage models [30, 34].\\n• KM scaling law5. In 2020, Kaplan et al. [30] (the OpenAI\\nteam) firstly proposed to model the power-law relationship\\nof model performance with respective to three major factors,\\nnamely model size (N), dataset size (D), and the amount of\\ntraining compute ( C), for neural language models. Given\\na compute budget c, they empirically presented three basic\\nformulas for the scaling law6:\\nL(N) =\\n\\x12Nc\\nN\\n\\x13αN\\n, α N ∼ 0.076, Nc ∼ 8.8 × 1013 (1)\\nL(D) =\\n\\x12Dc\\nD\\n\\x13αD\\n, α D ∼ 0.095, Dc ∼ 5.4 × 1013\\nL(C) =\\n\\x12Cc\\nC\\n\\x13αC\\n, α C ∼ 0.050, Cc ∼ 3.1 × 108\\nwhere L(·) denotes the cross entropy loss in nats, and\\na follow-up study [58] from OpenAI has shown that the\\nlanguage modeling loss can be decomposed into two parts,\\nnamely irreducible loss (the entropy of the true data distri-\\nbution) and reducible loss (an estimate of the KL divergence\\nbetween the true and model distributions). The three laws\\nwere derived by fitting the model performance with varied\\ndata sizes (22M to 23B tokens), model sizes (768M to 1.5B\\nnon-embedding parameters) and training compute, under\\nsome assumptions ( e.g., the analysis of one factor should\\nbe not bottlenecked by the other two factors). They showed\\nthat the model performance has a strong dependence rela-\\ntion on the three factors.\\n• Chinchilla scaling law . As another representative study,\\nHoffmann et al. [34] (the Google DeepMind team) proposed\\nan alternative form for scaling laws to instruct the compute-\\noptimal training for LLMs. They conducted rigorous exper-\\niments by varying a larger range of model sizes (70M to\\n16B) and data sizes (5B to 500B tokens), and fitted a similar\\nscaling law yet with different coefficients as below [34]:\\nL(N, D) = E + A\\nNα + B\\nDβ , (2)\\nwhere E = 1 .69, A= 406 .4, B= 410 .7, α = 0 .34 and\\nβ = 0 .28. By optimizing the loss L(N, D) under the con-\\nstraint C ≈ 6ND, they showed that the optimal allocation\\nof compute budget to model size and data size can be\\nderived as follows:\\nNopt(C) =G\\n\\x12C\\n6\\n\\x13a\\n, D opt(C) =G−1\\n\\x12C\\n6\\n\\x13b\\n, (3)\\nwhere a = α\\nα+β , b = β\\nα+β and G is a scaling coefficient that\\ncan be computed by A, B, α and β. As analyzed in [34],\\n5. Since there was not a model trained following this law in the\\noriginal paper, we took the last names of the two co-first authors to\\nname this scaling law.\\n6. Here, Nc, Dc and Cc are measured in the number of non-\\nembedding parameters, the number of training tokens and the number\\nof FP-days, respectively. According to the original paper [30],Cc and C\\nshould be denoted by Cmin\\nc and Cmin, corresponding to the optimal\\nuse of compute. We use the simplified notations for ease of discussions.'),\n",

After introducing the formu-\\nlations, we continue to discuss scaling law in the following\\ntwo aspects, to enhance its understanding:\\n• Predictable scaling. In practice, scaling law can be used\\nto instruct the training of LLMs, and it has been proven\\nfeasible to reliably estimate the performance of larger mod-\\nels based on that of smaller models, called predictable scal-\\ning [46]. The benefits of predictable scaling for training\\nLLMs are mainly twofold. Firstly, for large models, it is\\ninfeasible to rigorously examine various training tricks or\\nvariants, and it would be very helpful if experiences gained\\nfrom small models could also apply to large models. For\\ninstance, small proxy models can be trained to find the\\noptimal schedule of the data mixture for large models [59].\\nSecondly, the training of large-scale models takes a long\\ntime, often suffering from issues such as training loss spike,\\nand scaling law can be employed to monitor the training\\nstatus of LLMs, e.g., identifying abnormal performance at an\\nearly time. Despite that scaling law characterizes a smooth\\ntrend of performance increase (or loss decrease), it also\\nindicates that diminishing returns 7 might occur as model\\nscaling. An empirical study [58] from the OpenAI team\\nhas shown that representation quality or semantic content\\ncan still effectively improve even if approaching the point\\nof diminishing returns ( i.e., approaching the irreducible\\nloss) [58]. This finding suggests that training large models\\nare promising for improving the performance of down-\\nstream tasks. To further explore scaling effect, a potential\\nissue is that the amount of available data for training LLMs\\nis actually limited. With the ever-increasing model scale, the\\npublic text data would be soon “exhausted” for LLMs [60].\\nThus, it will be meaningful to study how scaling laws apply\\nto a data-constrained regime [61], where data repetition or\\naugmentation might be useful to alleviate data scarcity.\\n• Task-level predictability. Existing research of scaling laws\\nare mostly conducted in terms of language modeling loss\\n(e.g., per-token cross-entropy loss in nats [30]), while in\\npractice we are more concerned about the performance of\\nLLMs on actual tasks. Thus, a basic problem is that how\\nthe decrease of language modeling loss translates into the\\nimprovement of task performance [58]. Intuitively, a model\\nwith a smaller language modeling loss tends to yield a\\nbetter performance on downstream tasks, since language\\nmodeling loss can be considered as a general measure of\\nthe overall model capacity. GPT-4 [46] has reported that\\nsome capabilities ( e.g., coding ability) can be accurately\\npredicted via scaling law. Despite that, readers should be\\naware that a direct decrease in language modeling loss does\\nnot always indicate an improvement of model performance\\non downstream tasks. Specially, the phenomenon of inverse\\nscaling would occur for some tasks, where task performance\\nsurprisingly becomes worse as the language modeling loss\\ndecreases [62]. Overall, it is more difficult to explore and\\n7. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing returns\\ncharacterize task-level scaling laws, since it might be also\\ndependent on task-related information (task metric, task\\ndifficulty, etc.). Furthermore, some capacities (e.g., in-context\\nlearning [55]) are unpredictable according to the scaling law,\\nwhich can be observed only when the model size exceeds a\\ncertain level (as discussed below).\\nEmergent Abilities of LLMs . In the literature [31], emergent\\nabilities of LLMs are formally defined as “the abilities that\\nare not present in small models but arise in large models”,\\nwhich is one of the most prominent features that distin-\\nguish LLMs from previous PLMs. It further introduces a\\nnotable characteristic when emergent abilities occur [31]:\\nperformance rises significantly above random when the\\nscale reaches a certain level. By analogy, such an emergent\\npattern has close connections with the phenomenon of phase\\ntransition in physics [31, 63]. In principle, emergent abilities\\ncan be defined in relation to some complex tasks [31, 64],\\nwhile we are more concerned with general abilities that\\ncan be applied to solve a variety of tasks. Here, we briefly\\nintroduce three typical emergent abilities for LLMs and\\nrepresentative models that possess such an ability 8.\\n• In-context learning. The in-context learning (ICL) ability\\nis formally introduced by GPT-3 [55]: assuming that the\\nlanguage model has been provided with a natural language\\ninstruction and/or several task demonstrations, it can gen-\\nerate the expected output for the test instances by com-\\npleting the word sequence of input text, without requiring\\nadditional training or gradient update 9. Among the GPT-\\nseries models, the 175B GPT-3 model exhibited a strong ICL\\nability in general, but not the GPT-1 and GPT-2 models. Such\\nan ability also depends on the specific downstream task. For\\nexample, the ICL ability can emerge on the arithmetic tasks\\n(e.g., the 3-digit addition and subtraction) for the 13B GPT-3,\\nbut 175B GPT-3 even cannot work well on the Persian QA\\ntask [31].\\n• Instruction following. By fine-tuning with a mixture of\\nmulti-task datasets formatted via natural language descrip-\\ntions (called instruction tuning), LLMs are shown to perform\\nwell on unseen tasks that are also described in the form\\nof instructions [28, 66, 67]. With instruction tuning, LLMs\\nare enabled to follow the task instructions for new tasks\\nwithout using explicit examples, thus having an improved\\ngeneralization ability. According to the experiments in [67],\\ninstruction-tuned LaMDA-PT [68] started to significantly\\noutperform the untuned one on unseen tasks when the\\nmodel size reached 68B, but not for 8B or smaller model\\nsizes. A recent study [69] found that a model size of 62B is\\nat least required for PaLM to perform well on various tasks\\nin four evaluation benchmarks ( i.e., MMLU, BBH, TyDiQA\\nand MGSM), though a much smaller size might suffice for\\nsome specific tasks (e.g., MMLU).\\n• Step-by-step reasoning. For small language models, it\\nis usually difficult to solve complex tasks that involve\\n8. It is difficult to accurately examine the critical size for emergent\\nabilities of LLMs ( i.e., the minimum size to possess an ability), since it\\nmight vary for different models or tasks. Also, existing studies often\\ntest emergent abilities on very limited model sizes for a specific LLM.\\nFor example, PaLM is often tested with three sizes of 8B, 62B and 540B.\\nIt is unclear about the model performance of the untested sizes.\\n9. In a recent study [65], it also shows that in-context learning implic-\\nitly performs meta-optimization through the attention mechanism.'),\n",

This ability is speculated\\nto be potentially obtained by training on code [33, 47]. An\\nempirical study [33] has shown that CoT prompting can\\nbring performance gains (on arithmetic reasoning bench-\\nmarks) when applied to PaLM and LaMDA variants with\\na model size larger than 60B, while its advantage over\\nthe standard prompting becomes more evident when the\\nmodel size exceeds 100B. Furthermore, the performance\\nimprovement with CoT prompting seems to be also varied\\nfor different tasks, e.g., GSM8K > MAWPS > SWAMP for\\nPaLM [33].\\nHow Emergent Abilities Relate to Scaling Laws. In existing\\nliterature [30, 31, 34], scaling laws and emergent abilities\\nprovide two perspectives to understand the advantage of\\nlarge models over small models. In general, scaling law\\n(often measured by language modeling loss ) describes pre-\\ndictable performance relation with the potential effect of\\ndiminishing returns, while emergent abilities (often mea-\\nsured by task performance) are unpredictable but very prof-\\nitable once such abilities actually emerge. Since the two\\nperspectives reflect different performance trends (continu-\\nous improvement v.s. sharp performance leap), they might\\nlead to misaligned findings or observations. There are also\\nextensive debates on the rationality of emergent abilities.\\nA popular speculation is that emergent abilities might be\\npartially attributed to the evaluation setting for special tasks\\n(e.g., the discontinuous evaluation metrics) [70, 71]: when\\nevaluation metrics are altered accordingly, the sharpness of\\nthe emergent ability curve would disappear. However, the\\nperformance of LLMs on most tasks are perceived by users\\nnaturally in a discontinuous way. For instance, end users\\nprefer a reliable code generated by LLMs that can success-\\nfully pass the test case, but are less interested in selecting a\\nbetter code with fewer errors between two failed ones. More\\nrecently, a study [72] proposes a new evaluation setting\\nthat can enlarge the resolution of task metrics, making task\\nperformance more predictable. Despite these efforts, more\\nfundamental research ( e.g., grokking10) about the working\\nmechanism of LLMs is still in need to understand the emer-\\ngence of certain abilities. The subtle relation between scaling\\nlaw and emergent abilities can be explained by analogy with\\nthe ability acquisition of human11. Take the speaking ability\\nas an example. For children, language development (espe-\\ncially infants) can be also considered as a multi-level process\\nwhere “emergent abilities” occur. Specially, the language\\nability would relatively stable within a time interval, but\\nqualitative change only occurs when evolving into another\\nability level ( e.g., from speaking simple words to speaking\\nsimple sentences). Such a learning process is essentially not\\nsmooth and stable (i.e., language ability does not develop at\\na constant rate over time), though a child actually grows\\n10. Grokking refers that “a pattern in the data, improving generaliza-\\ntion performance from random chance level to perfect generalization”,\\nquoted from the original paper [73].\\n11. This explanation is only for ease of understanding, and there is\\nnot direct evidence to connect the two points.\\nevery day. It is interesting that young parents would be often\\nsurprised by unexpected progress of the speaking ability\\nexhibited by their babies.\\nKey Techniques for LLMs . It has been a long way that\\nLLMs evolve into the current state: general and capable\\nlearners. In the development process, a number of impor-\\ntant techniques are proposed, which largely improve the\\ncapacity of LLMs. Here, we briefly list several important\\ntechniques that (potentially) lead to the success of LLMs, as\\nfollows.\\n• Scaling. As discussed in previous parts, there exists\\nan evident scaling effect in Transformer language mod-\\nels: larger model/data sizes and more training compute\\ntypically lead to an improved model capacity [30, 34]. As\\ntwo representative models, GPT-3 and PaLM explored the\\nscaling limits by increasing the model size to 175B and\\n540B, respectively. Since compute budget is usually limited,\\nscaling laws can be further employed to conduct a more\\ncompute-efficient allocation of the compute resources. For\\nexample, Chinchilla (with more training tokens) outper-\\nforms its counterpart model Gopher (with a larger model\\nsize) by increasing the data scale with the same compute\\nbudget [34]. In addition, data scaling should be with careful\\ncleaning process, since the quality of pre-training data plays\\na key role in the model capacity.\\n• Training. Due to the huge model size, it is very chal-\\nlenging to successfully train a capable LLM. Distributed\\ntraining algorithms are needed to learn the network param-\\neters of LLMs, in which various parallel strategies are of-\\nten jointly utilized. To support distributed training, several\\noptimization frameworks have been released to facilitate\\nthe implementation and deployment of parallel algorithms,\\nsuch as DeepSpeed [74] and Megatron-LM [75–77]. Also, op-\\ntimization tricks are also important for training stability and\\nmodel performance, e.g., restart to overcome training loss\\nspike [56] and mixed precision training [78]. More recently,\\nGPT-4 [46] proposes to develop special infrastructure and\\noptimization methods that reliably predict the performance\\nof large models with much smaller models.\\n• Ability eliciting. After being pre-trained on large-scale\\ncorpora, LLMs are endowed with potential abilities as\\ngeneral-purpose task solvers. These abilities might not be\\nexplicitly exhibited when LLMs perform some specific tasks.\\nAs the technical approach, it is useful to design suitable task\\ninstructions or specific in-context learning strategies to elicit\\nsuch abilities. For instance, chain-of-thought prompting has\\nbeen shown to be useful to solve complex reasoning tasks\\nby including intermediate reasoning steps. Furthermore,\\nwe can perform instruction tuning on LLMs with task\\ndescriptions expressed in natural language, for improving\\nthe generalizability of LLMs on unseen tasks. These eliciting\\ntechniques mainly correspond to the emergent abilities of\\nLLMs, which may not show the same effect on small lan-\\nguage models.\\n• Alignment tuning . Since LLMs are trained to capture\\nthe data characteristics of pre-training corpora (including\\nboth high-quality and low-quality data), they are likely to\\ngenerate toxic, biased, or even harmful content for humans.\\nIt is necessary to align LLMs with human values,e.g., helpful,\\nhonest, and harmless. For this purpose, InstructGPT [66]'),\n",

ChatGPT is indeed developed\\non a similar technique to InstructGPT, which shows a strong\\nalignment capacity in producing high-quality, harmless re-\\nsponses, e.g., rejecting to answer insulting questions.\\n• Tools manipulation. In essence, LLMs are trained as text\\ngenerators over massive plain text corpora, thus performing\\nless well on the tasks that are not best expressed in the\\nform of text (e.g., numerical computation). In addition, their\\ncapacities are also limited to the pre-training data, e.g., the\\ninability to capture up-to-date information. To tackle these\\nissues, a recently proposed technique is to employ external\\ntools to compensate for the deficiencies of LLMs [80, 81].\\nFor example, LLMs can utilize the calculator for accurate\\ncomputation [80] and employ search engines to retrieve\\nunknown information [81]. More recently, ChatGPT has\\nenabled the mechanism of using external plugins (existing\\nor newly created apps) 12, which are by analogy with the\\n“eyes and ears ” of LLMs. Such a mechanism can broadly\\nexpand the scope of capacities for LLMs.\\nIn addition, many other factors ( e.g., the upgrade of\\nhardware) also contribute to the success of LLMs. Currently,\\nwe limit our discussion to the major technical approaches\\nand key findings for developing LLMs.\\n2.2 Technical Evolution of GPT-series Models\\nDue to the excellent capacity in communicating with hu-\\nmans, ChatGPT has ignited the excitement of the AI com-\\nmunity since its release. ChatGPT is developed based on the\\npowerful GPT model with specially optimized conversation\\ncapacities. Considering the ever-growing interest in Chat-\\nGPT and GPT models, we add a special discussion about the\\ntechnical evolution of the GPT-series models, to briefly sum-\\nmarize the progress how they have been developed in the\\npast years. Meanwhile, we drew a schematic diagram de-\\npicting the technological evolution of the GPT-series models\\nin Figure 4. The basic principle underlying GPT models is\\nto compress the world knowledge into the decoder-only\\nTransformer model by language modeling, such that it can\\nrecover (or memorize) the semantics of world knowledge\\nand serve as a general-purpose task solver. Two key points\\nto the success are (I) training decoder-only Transformer\\nlanguage models that can accurately predict the next word\\nand (II) scaling up the size of language models . Overall, the\\nresearch of OpenAI on LLMs can be roughly divided into\\nthe following stages13.\\nEarly Explorations . According to one interview with Ilya\\nSutskever14 (a co-founder and chief scientist of OpenAI),\\nthe idea of approaching intelligent systems with language\\n12. https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins\\n13. Note that the discussion of this part can be somewhat subjective.\\nThe overall viewpoints and summaries are made based on the under-\\nstanding of the survey authors by reading the papers, blog articles,\\ninterview reports and APIs released by OpenAI.\\n14. https://hackernoon.com/an-interview-with-ilya-sutskever-co-\\nfounder-of-openai\\nmodels was already explored in the early days of Ope-\\nnAI, while it was attempted with recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNN) [121]. With the advent of Transformer, OpenAI\\ndeveloped two initial GPT models, namely GPT-1 [122] and\\nGPT-2 [26], which can be considered as the foundation to\\nmore powerful models subsequently i.e., GPT-3 and GPT-4.\\n• GPT-1. In 2017, the Transformer model [22] was intro-\\nduced by Google, and the OpenAI team quickly adapted\\ntheir language modeling work to this new neural network\\narchitecture. They released the first GPT model in 2018,\\ni.e., GPT-1 [122], and coined the abbreviation term GPT\\nas the model name, standing for Generative Pre-Training .\\nGPT-1 was developed based on a generative, decoder-only\\nTransformer architecture, and adopted a hybrid approach of\\nunsupervised pretraining and supervised fine-tuning. GPT-\\n1 has set up the core architecture for the GPT-series models\\nand established the underlying principle to model natural\\nlanguage text, i.e., predicting the next word.\\n• GPT-2. Following a similar architecture of GPT-1,\\nGPT-2 [26] increased the parameter scale to 1.5B, which\\nwas trained with a large webpage dataset WebText. As\\nclaimed in the paper of GPT-2, it sought to perform\\ntasks via unsupervised language modeling, without explicit\\nfine-tuning using labeled data. To motivate the approach,\\nthey introduced a probabilistic form for multi-task solving,\\ni.e., p(output|input, task) (similar approaches have been\\nadopted in [123]), which predicts the output conditioned on\\nthe input and task information. To model this conditional\\nprobability, language text can be naturally employed as a\\nunified way to format input, output and task information.\\nIn this way, the process of solving a task can be cast as a\\nword prediction problem for generating the solution text.\\nFurther, they introduced a more formal claim for this idea:\\n“Since the (task-specific) supervised objective is the same\\nas the unsupervised (language modeling) objective but only\\nevaluated on a subset of the sequence, the global minimum\\nof the unsupervised objective is also the global minimum\\nof the supervised objective (for various tasks)” [26] 15. A\\nbasic understanding of this claim is that each (NLP) task\\ncan be considered as the word prediction problem based\\non a subset of the world text. Thus, unsupervised language\\nmodeling could be capable in solving various tasks, if it was\\ntrained to have sufficient capacity in recovering the world\\ntext. These early discussion in GPT-2’s paper echoed in the\\ninterview of Ilya Sutskever by Jensen Huang: “What the\\nneural network learns is some representation of the process\\nthat produced the text. This text is actually a projection of\\nthe world...the more accurate you are in predicting the next\\nword, the higher the fidelity, the more resolution you get in\\nthis process...”16.\\nCapacity Leap . Although GPT-2 is intended to be an “un-\\nsupervised multitask learner”, it overall has an inferior\\nperformance compared with supervised fine-tuning state-\\nof-the-art methods. Because it has a relatively small model\\nsize, it has been widely fine-tuned in downstream tasks,\\nespecially the dialog tasks [124, 125]. Based on GPT-2, GPT-3\\n15.

GPT-3 [55] was released in 2020, which scaled\\nthe model parameters to an ever larger size of 175B. In\\nthe GPT-3’s paper, it formally introduced the concept of\\nin-context learning (ICL) 17, which utilizes LLMs in a few-\\nshot or zero-shot way. ICL can teach (or instruct) LLMs to\\nunderstand the tasks in the form of natural language text.\\nWith ICL, the pre-training and utilization of LLMs converge\\nto the same language modeling paradigm: pre-training pre-\\ndicts the following text sequence conditioned on the context,\\nwhile ICL predicts the correct task solution, which can be\\nalso formatted as a text sequence, given the task description\\n17. GPT-2 essentially used ICL for unsupervised task learning,\\nthough it wasn’t called ICL at that time.\\nand demonstrations. GPT-3 not only demonstrates very ex-\\ncellent performance in a variety of NLP tasks, but also on a\\nnumber of specially designed tasks that require the abilities\\nof reasoning or domain adaptation. Although the GPT-3’s\\npaper does not explicitly discuss the emergent abilities of\\nLLMs, we can observe large performance leap that might\\ntranscend the basic scaling law [30], e.g., larger models have\\nsignificantly stronger ICL ability (illustrated in the original\\nFigure 1.2 of the GPT-3’s paper [55]). Overall, GPT-3 can be\\nviewed as a remarkable landmark in the journey evolving\\nfrom PLMs to LLMs. It has empirically proved that scaling\\nthe neural networks to a significant size can lead to a huge\\nincrease in model capacity.\\nCapacity Enhancement.

Overall, OpenAI has explored two major\\napproaches to further improving the GPT-3 model,i.e., train-\\ning on code data and alignment with human preference,\\nwhich are detailed as follows.\\n• Training on code data. A major limitation of the original\\nGPT-3 model (pre-trained on plain text) lies in the lack of\\nthe reasoning ability on complex tasks, e.g., completing the\\ncode and solving math problems. To enhance this ability,\\nCodex [105] was introduced by OpenAI in July 2021, which\\nwas a GPT model fine-tuned on a large corpus of GitHub\\ncode. It demonstrated that Codex can solve very difficult\\nprogramming problems, and also lead to a significant per-\\nformance improvement in solving math problems [126].\\nFurther, a contrastive approach [127] to training text and\\ncode embedding was reported in January 2022, which was\\nshown to improve a series of related tasks ( i.e., linear-\\nprobe classification, text search and code search). Actually,\\nthe GPT-3.5 models are developed based on a code-based\\nGPT model (i.e., code-davinci-002), which indicates that\\ntraining on code data is a very useful practice to improve\\nthe model capacity of GPT models, especially the reasoning\\nability. Furthermore, there is also a speculation that train-\\ning on code data can greatly increase the chain-of-thought\\nprompting abilities of LLMs [47], while it is still worth\\nfurther investigation with more thorough verification.\\n• Human alignment . The related research of human\\nalignment can be dated back to the year 2017 (or earlier)\\nfor OpenAI: a blog article entitled “learning from human\\npreferences”18 was posted on the OpenAI blog describing\\na work that applied reinforcement learning (RL) to learn\\nfrom the preference comparisons annotated by humans [79]\\n(similar to the reward training step in the aligning algorithm\\nof InstructGPT in Figure 12). Shortly after the release of this\\nRL paper [79], the paper of the Proximal Policy Optimiza-\\ntion (PPO) [128] was published in July 2017, which now has\\nbeen the foundational RL algorithm for learning from hu-\\nman preferences [66]. Later in January 2020, GPT-2 was fine-\\ntuned using the aforementioned RL algorithms [79, 128],\\nwhich leveraged human preferences to improve the capac-\\nities of GPT-2 on NLP tasks. In the same year, another\\nwork [129] trained a summarization model for optimizing\\nhuman preferences in a similar way. Based on these prior\\nwork, InstructGPT [66] was proposed in January 2022 to\\nimprove the GPT-3 model for human alignment, which\\nformally established a three-stage reinforcement learning from\\nhuman feedback (RLHF) algorithm. Note that it seems that\\nthe wording of “instruction tuning” has seldom been used in\\nOpenAI’s paper and documentation, which is substituted by\\nsupervised fine-tuning on human demonstrations (i.e., the first\\nstep of the RLHF algorithm [66]). In addition to improving\\nthe instruction following capacity, the RLHF algorithm is\\nparticularly useful to mitigate the issues of generating harm\\nor toxic content for LLMs, which is key to the safe deploy-\\nment of LLMs in practice. OpenAI describes their approach\\nto alignment research in a technical article [130], which\\nhas summarized three promising directions: “training AI\\nsystems to use human feedback, to assist human evaluation\\nand to do alignment research”.\\nThese enhancement techniques lead to the improved\\n18. https://openai.com/research/learning-from-human-preferences\\nGPT-3 models with stronger capacities, which are called\\nGPT-3.5 models by OpenAI (see the discussion about the\\nOpenAI API in Section 3.1).\\nThe Milestones of Language Models . Based on all the ex-\\nploration efforts, two major milestones have been achieved\\nby OpenAI, namely ChatGPT [131] and GPT-4 [46], which\\nhave largely raised the capacity bar of existing AI systems.\\n• ChatGPT. In November 2022, OpenAI released the\\nconversation model ChatGPT, based on the GPT models\\n(GPT-3.5 and GPT-4). As the official blog article intro-\\nduced [131], ChatGPT was trained in a similar way as\\nInstructGPT (called “a sibling model to InstructGPT” in the\\noriginal post), while specially optimized for dialogue. They\\nreported a difference between the training of ChatGPT and\\nInstructGPT in the data collection setup: human-generated\\nconversations (playing both the roles of user and AI) are\\ncombined with the InstructGPT dataset in a dialogue format\\nfor training ChatGPT. ChatGPT exhibited superior capaci-\\nties in communicating with humans: possessing a vast store\\nof knowledge, skill at reasoning on mathematical problems,\\ntracing the context accurately in multi-turn dialogues, and\\naligning well with human values for safe use. Later on, the\\nplugin mechanism has been supported in ChatGPT, which\\nfurther extends the capacities of ChatGPT with existing tools\\nor apps. So far, it seems to be the ever most powerful chatbot\\nin the AI history. The launch of ChatGPT has a significant\\nimpact on the AI research in the future, which sheds light\\non the exploration of human-like AI systems.\\n• GPT-4. As another remarkable progress, GPT-4 [46] was\\nreleased in March 2023, which extended the text input to\\nmultimodal signals. Overall, GPT-4 has stronger capacities\\nin solving complex tasks than GPT-3.5, showing a large\\nperformance improvement on many evaluation tasks. A re-\\ncent study [41] investigated the capacities of GPT-4 by con-\\nducting qualitative tests with human-generated problems,\\nspanning a diverse range of difficult tasks, and showed\\nthat GPT-4 can achieve more superior performance than\\nprior GPT models such as ChatGPT. Furthermore, GPT-4\\nresponds more safely to malicious or provocative queries,\\ndue to a six-month iterative alignment (with an additional\\nsafety reward signal in the RLHF training). In the technical\\nreport, OpenAI has emphasized how to safely develop\\nGPT-4 and applied a number of intervention strategies to\\nmitigate the possible issues of LLMs, such as hallucinations,\\nprivacy and overreliance. For example, they introduced the\\nmechanism called red teaming [132] to reduce the harm or\\ntoxic content generation. As another important aspect, GPT-\\n4 has been developed on a well-established deep learning\\ninfrastructure with improved optimization methods. They\\nintroduced a new mechanism called predictable scaling that\\ncan accurately predict the final performance with a small\\nproportion of compute during model training.\\n• GPT-4V , GPT-4 turbo, and beyond . Based on the work\\ndone for GPT-4 [46], OpenAI further released GPT-4V in\\nSeptember 2023, which focused on the safe deployment of\\nthe vision capabilities of GPT-4. In the GPT-4V’s system\\ncard [133], it has extensively discussed the assessment and\\nmitigation of risks related to visually augmented inputs.\\nSpecially, GPT-4V exhibited strong vision capacities in var-\\nious application scenarios, showing the great potential as'),\n",

More recently, in\\nNovember 2023, OpenAI released an upgraded generation\\nof GPT-4 model at DevDay, named GPT-4 Turbo, with a\\nseries of technical improvements. GPT-4 Turbo is featured\\nby the improved model capacity (more capable than GPT-\\n4), the extended knowledge source (up to April 2023),\\nlong context window (up to 128k tokens), optimized model\\nperformance (cheaper price), and other useful functional-\\nity updates (function call, reproducible outputs, etc.). At\\nthe same time, Assistants API was launched to ease the\\nrapid development of agent-like assistants. With this API,\\ndevelopers can easily create goal-oriented assistants within\\ntheir applications, by leveraging specific instruction, extra\\nknowledge and tool use. Furthermore, multimodal capaci-\\nties (see, hear, and speak) were also enhanced in this new\\nrelease, supported by GPT-4 Turbo with vision, DALL·E 3,\\nText-to-speech (TTS), and Listen to voice samples. These\\nimprovements have greatly extended the capacity scope and\\nenhanced the task performance of GPT models. More impor-\\ntantly, the application ecosystem will be greatly strength-\\nened with the technology upgrade in improved models,\\nAPIs, and functionalities.\\nDespite the huge progress, there are still limitations with\\nthese superior LLMs, e.g., generating hallucinations with\\nfactual errors or potentially risky response within some\\nspecific context [46]. More limitations or issues of LLMs will\\nbe discussed in Section 7. It poses long-standing research\\nchallenges to develop more capable, safer LLMs. From\\nthe perspective of engineering, OpenAI has adopted an\\niterative deployment strategy [134] to develop the models\\nand products by following a five-stage development and\\ndeployment life-cycle, which aims to effectively reduce the\\npotential risks of using the models. In the following, we\\nwill dive into the technical details in order to have a specific\\nunderstanding of how they have been developed.\\n3 R ESOURCES OF LLM S\\nIt is by no means an easy job to develop or reproduce LLMs,\\nconsidering the challenging technical issues and huge de-\\nmands of computation resources. A feasible way is to learn\\nexperiences from existing LLMs and reuse publicly avail-\\nable resources for incremental development or experimental\\nstudy. In this section, we briefly summarize the publicly\\navailable resources for developing LLMs, including model\\ncheckpoints (or APIs), corpora and libraries.\\n3.1 Publicly Available Model Checkpoints or APIs\\nGiven the huge cost of model pre-training, well-trained\\nmodel checkpoints are critical to the study and development\\nof LLMs for the research community. Since the parameter\\nscale is a key factor to consider for using LLMs, we cate-\\ngorize these public models into two scale levels ( i.e., tens\\nof billions of parameters and hundreds of billions of parameters ),\\nwhich is useful for users to identify the suitable resources ac-\\ncording to their resource budget. In addition, for inference,\\nwe can directly employ public APIs to perform our tasks,\\nwithout running the model locally. Next, we introduce the\\npublicly available model checkpoints and APIs.\\nModels with Tens of Billions of Parameters . Most of the\\nmodels in this category have a parameter scale ranging from\\n10B to 20B, except LLaMA [57] and LLaMA2 [99] (con-\\ntaining 70B parameters in the largest version), NLLB [91]\\n(containing 54.5B parameters in the largest version), and\\nFalcon [135] (containing 40B parameters in the largest ver-\\nsion). Other models within this range include mT5 [83],\\nPanGu-α [84], T0 [28], GPT-NeoX-20B [87], CodeGen [86],\\nUL2 [89], Flan-T5 [69], and mT0 [94]. Among them, Flan-\\nT5 (11B version) can serve as a premier model for re-\\nsearch on instruction tuning, since it explores the instruction\\ntuning from three aspects [69]: increasing the number of\\ntasks, scaling the model size, and fine-tuning with chain-of-\\nthought prompting data. Besides, CodeGen (11B version), as\\nan autoregressive language model designed for generating\\ncode, can be considered as a good candidate for exploring\\nthe code generation ability. It also introduces a new bench-\\nmark MTPB [86] specially for multi-turn program synthesis,\\nwhich is composed by 115 expert-generated problems. To\\nsolve these problems, it requires LLMs to acquire sufficient\\nprogramming knowledge ( e.g., math, array operations, and\\nalgorithms). More recently, CodeGen2 [97] has been released\\nto explore the impact of choices in model architecture,\\nlearning algorithms, and data distributions on the model. As\\nanother LLM specialized in coding abilities, StarCoder [98]\\nhas also achieved excellent results. As for multilingual tasks,\\nmT0 (13B version) might be a good candidate model, which\\nhas been fine-tuned on multilingual tasks with multilingual\\nprompts. Furthermore, PanGu- α [84] shows good perfor-\\nmance in Chinese downstream tasks in zero-shot or few-\\nshot settings, which is developed based on the deep learn-\\ning framework MindSpore [136]. Note that PanGu- α [84]\\nholds multiple versions of models (up to 200B parameters),\\nwhile the largest public version has 13B parameters. As\\na popular LLM, LLaMA (65B version) [57], which contains\\napproximately five times as many parameters as other mod-\\nels, has exhibited superior performance in tasks related to\\ninstruction following. Compared to LLaMA, LLaMA2 [99]\\nhas made more explorations in reinforcement learning from\\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and developed a chat-oriented\\nversion called LLaMA-chat, which generally outperforms ex-\\nisting open-source models across a range of helpfulness and\\nsafety benchmarks. Due to the openness and effectiveness,\\nLLaMA has attracted significant attention from the research\\ncommunity, and many efforts [137–140] have been devoted\\nto fine-tuning or continually pre-training its different model\\nversions for implementing new models or tools.

To support incremental update, we share the source file of\\nthis figure, and welcome the readers to include the desired models by submitting the pull requests on our GitHub page.\\nModels with Hundreds of Billions of Parameters . For\\nmodels in this category, only a handful of models have been\\npublicly released. For example, OPT [90], OPT-IML [95],\\nBLOOM [78], and BLOOMZ [94] have nearly the same num-\\nber of parameters as GPT-3 (175B version), while GLM [93]\\nand Galactica [35] have 130B and 120B parameters, re-\\nspectively. Among them, OPT (175B version), with the\\ninstruction-tuned version OPT-IML, has been specially mo-\\ntivated for open sharing, which aims to enable researchers\\nto carry out reproducible research at scale. For research\\nin cross-lingual generalization, BLOOM (176B version) and\\nBLOOMZ (176B version) can be used as base models, due to\\nthe competence in multilingual language modeling tasks.\\nAs a bilingual LLM, GLM has also provided a popular\\nsmall-sized Chinese chat model ChatGLM2-6B (a updated\\nversion for ChatGLM-6B), which is featured with many\\nimprovements in efficiency and capacity ( e.g., quantization,\\n32K-length context, fast inference rate). Models of this scale\\ntypically require thousands of GPUs or TPUs to train. For\\ninstance, OPT (175B version) used 992 A100-80GB GPUs,\\nwhile GLM (130B version) used a cluster of 96 NVIDIA\\nDGX-A100 (8x40G) GPU nodes.\\nLLaMA Model Family . The collection of LLaMA mod-\\nels [57] were introduced by Meta AI in February, 2023,\\nconsisting of four sizes (7B, 13B, 30B and 65B). Since\\nreleased, LLaMA has attracted extensive attention from\\nboth research and industry communities. LLaMA mod-\\nels have achieved very excellent performance on various\\nopen benchmarks, which have become the most popu-\\nlar open language models thus far. A large number of\\nresearchers have extended LLaMA models by either in-\\nstruction tuning or continual pretraining. In particular, in-\\nstruction tuning LLaMA has become a major approach\\nto developing customized or specialized models, due to\\nthe relatively low computational costs. To effectively adapt\\nLLaMA models in non-English languages, it often needs to\\nextend the original vocabulary (trained mainly on English\\ncorpus) or fine-tune it with instructions or data in the\\ntarget language. Among these extended models, Stanford\\nAlpaca [142] is the first open instruct-following model\\nfine-tuned based on LLaMA (7B). It is trained by 52K\\ninstruction-following demonstrations generated via self-\\ninstruct [143] using text-davinci-003. The instruction\\ndata, named Alpaca-52K, and training code have been ex-\\ntensively adopted in subsequent work, such as Alpaca-\\nLoRA [144] (a reproduction of Stanford Alpaca using\\nLoRA [145]), Koala [146], and BELLE [147]. In addition, Vi-\\ncuna [138] is another popular LLaMA variant, trained upon\\nuser-shared conversations collected from ShareGPT [148].\\nDue to the excellent performance and availability of the\\nLLaMA model family, many multimodal models incorpo-\\nrate them as the base language models, to achieve strong\\nlanguage understanding and generation abilities. Compared\\nwith other variants, Vicuna is more preferred in multimodal'),\n",

Instead of directly using the model\\ncopies, APIs provide a more convenient way for common\\nusers to use LLMs, without the need of running the model\\nlocally. As a representative interface for using LLMs, the\\nAPIs for the GPT-series models [46, 55, 66, 105] have\\nbeen widely used for both academia and industry 19.\\nOpenAI has provided seven major interfaces to the models\\nin GPT-3 series: ada, babbage, curie, davinci (the\\nmost powerful version in GPT-3 series), text-ada-001,\\ntext-babbage-001, and text-curie-001. Among\\nthem, the first four interfaces can be further fine-\\ntuned on the host server of OpenAI. In particular,\\nbabbage, curie, and davinci correspond to the\\nGPT-3 (1B), GPT-3 (6.7B), and GPT-3 (175B) models,\\nrespectively [55]. In addition, there are also two APIs\\nrelated to Codex [105], called code-cushman-001 (a\\npowerful and multilingual version of the Codex (12B) [105])\\nand code-davinci-002. Further, GPT-3.5 series\\ninclude one base model code-davinci-002 and\\nthree enhanced versions, namely text-davinci-002,\\ntext-davinci-003, and gpt-3.5-turbo. As more\\npowerful alternatives, in this year, OpenAI has released\\nthe model interfaces for GPT-4 series, including gpt-4,\\ngpt-4-32k, gpt-4-1106-preview (i.e., GPT-4 Turbo)\\nand gpt-4-vision-preview (i.e., GPT-4 Turbo with\\nvision, a multimodal model). It is worth noting that OpenAI\\nhas been maintaining and upgrading these model interfaces\\n(gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, gpt-4-32k), so the API name\\nwill actually point to the latest version. Currently, ChatGPT\\ncan be powered by either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 models. Overall,\\none select the suitable model interface based on the specific\\napplication scenarios and response requirements.

For\\nthis need, there are increasingly more accessible training\\ndatasets that have been released for research. In this section,\\nwe will briefly summarize several widely used corpora for\\ntraining LLMs. Based on their content types, we catego-\\nrize these corpora into six groups: Books, CommonCrawl,\\nReddit links, Wikipedia, Code, and others.\\nBooks. BookCorpus [153] is a commonly used dataset in\\nprevious small-scale models (e.g., GPT [122] and GPT-2 [26]),\\nconsisting of over 11,000 books covering a wide range of\\ntopics and genres ( e.g., novels and biographies). Another\\nlarge-scale book corpus is Project Gutenberg [154], consist-\\ning of over 70,000 literary books including novels, essays,\\npoetry, drama, history, science, philosophy, and other types\\nof works in the public domain. It is currently one of the\\nlargest open-source book collections, which is used in train-\\ning of MT-NLG [113] and LLaMA [57]. As for Books1 [55]\\nand Books2 [55] used in GPT-3 [55], they are much larger\\nthan BookCorpus but have not been publicly released so\\nfar.\\nCommonCrawl. CommonCrawl [163] is one of the largest\\nopen-source web crawling databases, containing a petabyte-\\nscale data volume, which has been widely used as training\\ndata for existing LLMs. As the whole dataset is very large,\\nexisting studies mainly extract subsets of web pages from\\nit within a specific period. However, due to the widespread\\nexistence of noisy and low-quality information in web data,\\nit is necessary to perform data preprocessing before usage.\\nBased on CommonCrawl, there are four filtered datasets\\nthat are commonly used in existing work: C4 [82], CC-\\nStories [155], CC-News [27], and RealNews [156]. The Colos-\\nsal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4) includes five variants 21,\\nnamely en (806G), en.noclean (6T), realnewslike (36G), web-\\ntextlike (17G), and multilingual (38T). The en version has\\nbeen utilized for pre-training T5 [82], LaMDA [68], Go-\\npher [64], and UL2 [89]. The multilingual C4, also called\\nmC4, has been used in mT5 [83]. CC-Stories (31G) is com-\\nposed of a subset of CommonCrawl data, in which the\\ncontents are made in a story-like way. Because the original\\nsource of CC-Stories is not available now, we include a re-\\nproduction version, CC-Stories-R [164], in Table 2. Moreover,\\ntwo news corpora extracted from CommonCrawl, i.e., RE-\\nALNEWS (120G) and CC-News (76G), are also commonly\\nused as the pre-training data.\\nReddit Links. Reddit is a social media platform that enables\\nusers to submit links and text posts, which can be voted on\\nby others through “upvotes” or “downvotes”. Highly up-\\nvoted posts are often considered useful, and can be utilized\\nto create high-quality datasets. WebText [26] is a well-known\\ncorpus composed of highly upvoted links from Reddit, but it\\nis not publicly available. As a surrogate, there is a readily ac-\\ncessible open-source alternative called OpenWebText [157].\\nAnother corpus extracted from Reddit is PushShift.io [158],\\na real-time updated dataset that consists of historical data\\nfrom Reddit since its creation day. Pushshift provides not\\nonly monthly data dumps but also useful utility tools to\\nsupport users in searching, summarizing, and conducting\\n21. https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4'),\n",

This makes\\nit easy for users to collect and process Reddit data.\\nWikipedia. Wikipedia [159] is an online encyclopedia con-\\ntaining a large volume of high-quality articles on diverse\\ntopics. Most of these articles are composed in an expository\\nstyle of writing (with supporting references), covering a\\nwide range of languages and fields. Typically, the English-\\nonly filtered versions of Wikipedia are widely used in most\\nLLMs ( e.g., GPT-3 [55], LaMDA [68], and LLaMA [57]).\\nWikipedia is available in multiple languages, so it can be\\nused in multilingual settings.\\nCode. To collect code data, existing work mainly crawls\\nopen-source licensed codes from the Internet. Two major\\nsources are public code repositories under open-source li-\\ncenses ( e.g., GitHub) and code-related question-answering\\nplatforms ( e.g., StackOverflow). Google has publicly re-\\nleased the BigQuery dataset [160], which includes a substan-\\ntial number of open-source licensed code snippets in various\\nprogramming languages, serving as a representative code\\ndataset. CodeGen has utilized BIGQUERY [86], a subset of\\nthe BigQuery dataset, for training the multilingual version\\nof CodeGen (CodeGen-Multi).\\nOthers. The Pile [161] is a large-scale, diverse, and open-\\nsource text dataset consisting of over 800GB of data from\\nmultiple sources, including books, websites, codes, scientific\\npapers, and social media platforms. It is constructed from\\n22 diverse high-quality subsets. The Pile dataset is widely\\nused in models with different parameter scales, such as\\nGPT-J (6B) [165], CodeGen (16B) [86], and Megatron-Turing\\nNLG (530B) [113]. ROOTS [162] is composed of various\\nsmaller datasets (totally 1.61 TB of text) and covers 59\\ndifferent languages (containing natural languages and pro-\\ngramming languages), which have been used for training\\nBLOOM [78].\\nIn practice, it commonly requires a mixture of different\\ndata sources for pre-training LLMs (see Figure 6), instead\\nof a single corpus. Therefore, existing studies commonly\\nmix several ready-made datasets ( e.g., C4, OpenWebText,\\nand the Pile), and then perform further processing to obtain\\nthe pre-training corpus. Furthermore, to train the LLMs that\\nare adaptive to specific applications, it is also important\\nto extract data from relevant sources ( e.g., Wikipedia and\\nBigQuery) for enriching the corresponding information in\\npre-training data. To have a quick reference of the data\\nsources used in existing LLMs, we present the pre-training\\ncorpora of three representative LLMs:\\n• GPT-3 (175B) [55] was trained on a mixed dataset of\\n300B tokens, including CommonCrawl [163], WebText2 [55],\\nBooks1 [55], Books2 [55], and Wikipedia [159].\\n• PaLM (540B) [56] uses a pre-training dataset of 780B\\ntokens, which is sourced from social media conversations,\\nfiltered webpages, books, Github, multilingual Wikipedia,\\nand news.\\n• LLaMA [57] extracts training data from various sources,\\nincluding CommonCrawl, C4 [82], Github, Wikipedia,\\nbooks, ArXiv, and StackExchange. The training data size for\\nLLaMA (6B) and LLaMA (13B) is 1.0T tokens, while 1.4T\\ntokens are used for LLaMA (32B) and LLaMA (65B).\\nTABLE 3: A detailed list of available collections for instruc-\\ntion tuning.\\nCategories Collections Time #Examples\\nTask\\nNat.

In this section, we mainly focus on\\ndiscussing the related available datasets for the two kinds of\\ntuning approaches, and more algorithm details can be found\\nin Section 5.\\n3.3.1 Instruction Tuning Datasets\\nAfter pre-training, instruction tuning (a.k.a., supervised fine-\\ntuning) is an important method to enhance or unlock spe-\\ncific abilities of LLMs ( e.g., instruction following). In this\\npart, we introduce several widely used datasets for in-\\nstruction tuning, and categorize them into three main types\\nbased on the construction method of formatted instruction\\ninstances, namely NLP task datasets, daily chat datasets and\\nsynthetic datasets. We show their details in Table 3.\\nNLP Task Datasets. This kind of datasets are formatted\\nbased on collected NLP task datasets ( e.g., text classifica-\\ntion and summarization) with corresponding natural lan-\\nguage task descriptions. In this category, P3 [182] and\\nFLAN [67, 183] are two widely used datasets for instruction\\ntuning.\\n• P3 [182] is composed of 170 English NLP datasets and\\n2,052 English prompt templates, where the input and output\\nof each data example have been formatted with specific\\nprompt templates for composing the training instance.'),\n",

Recently, FLAN-v2 [183] is also pro-\\nposed, which expands FLAN by mixing additional instruc-\\ntion datasets, including Muffin [67], NIV2 [88], T0-SF [28],\\nand CoT [184–186]. Muffin contains 62 tasks from the orig-\\ninal FLAN and additional 26 tasks, including conversation\\nand code synthesis tasks. T0-SF is extracted from T0 [28]\\nwhile ensuring no overlap with Muffin. NIV2 refers to the\\nNatural-Instructions v2 dataset [88], and CoT [184–186] is\\na combination of nine reasoning tasks with corresponding\\nchain-of-thought prompts and outputs.\\nDaily Chat Datasets. This kind of datasets are constructed\\nbased on real user conversations where queries are posed\\nby humans and responses are mainly generated by hu-\\nman labelers or LLMs ( e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-4). The con-\\nversation types include open-ended generation, question\\nanswering, brainstorming, and chatting. In this category,\\nShareGPT [148], OpenAssistant [173] and Dolly [172] are\\nthree commonly used datasets for LLM fine-tuning.\\n• ShareGPT [148] is collected from a data collection\\nplatform where users can upload their conversations with\\nChatGPT or GPT-4 through the ShareGPT API. Currently,\\nthis dataset consists of approximately 90,000 conversations,\\nincluding real instructions or inquiries from human and\\nresponses from ChatGPT.\\n• OpenAssistant [173] is a multilingual corpus containing\\n66,497 real-world conversation trees between human and AI\\nassistant. Each conversation tree consists of multiple nodes,\\nand each node represents the information generated by a\\nrole in the dialogue. It spans 35 languages and includes\\n461,292 manually annotated quality ratings of responses.\\n• Dolly [172] is an English dataset comprising 15,000\\nhuman-generated data instances (prompt-response pairs)\\nfrom Databricks. This dataset covers seven domains out-\\nlined in the InstructGPT [66], including brainstorming, clas-\\nsification, closed-book quality assurance, generation, infor-\\nmation extraction, open-book quality assurance, and sum-\\nmarization.\\nSynthetic Datasets. This kind of datasets are typically\\nconstructed by instructing LLMs, based on pre-defined\\nguidance rules or methods. In this category, Self-Instruct-\\n52K [143], Alpaca [142] and Baize [175] are three commonly\\nused synthetic datasets for LLMs.\\n• Self-Instruct-52K [143] is an instruction dataset gener-\\nated through the self-instruct [143] method, consisting of\\n82,000 instances with 52,000 instructions. Concretely, the\\nauthors construct 175 seed instances, and then iteratively\\nprompt the LLM [55] to synthesize additional instructions\\nbased on randomly selected 8 instructions as reference.\\nSubsequently, the LLM is further instructed to generate in-\\nstance inputs and their corresponding outputs based on the\\nsynthetic instructions, and finally obtain the Self-Instruct-\\n52K dataset.\\n• Alpaca [142] is also a synthetic dataset based on the self-\\ninstruct [143] method. It utilizes the text-davinci-003\\nmodel on the 175 seed datasets from Self-Instruct-52K to\\nobtain 52,000 new instructions and corresponding inputs\\nand outputs. Moreover, 60% of the examples are pure in-\\nstructions without the input part in the final dataset.\\n• Baize [175] is an English multi-turn conversation corpus\\nconstructed using ChatGPT, comprising 111.5K instances. To\\ncreate Baize, a method called “self-chat” [175] is purposed,\\nwhere ChatGPT takes on the roles of both the user and the\\nAI assistant in turns, generating information in a conversa-\\ntional format.\\n3.3.2 Alignment Datasets\\nApart from instruction tuning, it is important to construct\\nhigh-quality datasets for aligning LLMs with human values\\nand preferences ( e.g., helpfulness, honesty, and harmless-\\nness). In this section, we introduce several widely used\\ndatasets for alignment tuning, including HH-RLHF [170],\\nSHP [177], PKU-SafeRLHF [181], Stack Exchange Prefer-\\nences [178] and Sandbox Alignment Data [179]. We show\\ntheir details in Table 4.\\n• HH-RLHF [170] consists of around 169K instances, and\\ncan be divided into two parts that focus on the helpfulness\\nand harmlessness of LLMs, respectively. Each instance is\\nan open-ended conversation between a crowdworker and\\na chat model, about seeking assistance, advice, or task\\ncompletion. The chat model provides two responses to each\\nuser query, and the more helpful or harmful responses will\\nbe chosen as the annotations.\\n• SHP [177] focuses on the helpfulness of responses.\\nIt comprises 385K collective human preferences over re-\\nsponses to questions/instructions across 18 diverse subject\\nareas, spanning topics from cooking to legal advice. Each\\ninstance is a Reddit post containing a question or instruction\\nand a pair of top-level comments, one of which is deemed\\nas more preferable by Reddit users and the other one is\\ndeemed as less helpful. Different from HH-RLHF [170], the\\ndata in SHP consists of naturally occurring and human-\\nwritten responses.\\n• PKU-SafeRLHF [181] encompasses more than 330K\\ninstances of expert comparison data, concentrating on the\\nhelpfulness and harmlessness. Each instance in the dataset\\nincludes a question and two responses, accompanied by\\nsafety labels for each response and two preference anno-\\ntations between the two responses according to helpfulness\\nand harmlessness. The harmlessness of a response indicates\\nits classification as risk-neutral across all 14 harm categories,\\nwhile the helpfulness of a response is evaluated based on its\\neffectiveness in addressing the question.\\n• Stack Exchange Preferences [178] focuses on the help-\\nfulness of answers. It comprises about 10M questions and\\nanswers from Stack Overflow. Each instance consists of a\\nquestion and more than two corresponding answers. Each\\nanswer is annotated with a score calculated based on its\\nvotes and a label denoting whether it is selected.\\n• Sandbox Alignment Data [179] is an alignment dataset\\ncontaining feedback from LLMs rather than human.

Fur-\\nthermore, to effectively pre-train LLMs, model architectures,\\nacceleration methods, and optimization techniques need to\\nbe well designed. In what follows, we first discuss the data\\ncollection and processing in Section 4.1, then introduce the\\ncommonly used model architectures in Section 4.2, and fi-\\nnally present the training techniques to stably and efficiently\\noptimize LLMs in Section 4.3.\\n4.1 Data Collection and Preparation\\nCompared with small-scale language models, LLMs have\\na stronger demand for high-quality data for model pre-\\ntraining, and their model capacities largely rely on the pre-\\ntraining corpus and how it has been preprocessed.

Ex-\\nisting LLMs mainly leverage a mixture of diverse public\\ntextual datasets as the pre-training corpus. Figure 6 shows\\nthe distribution of the sources of pre-training data for a\\nnumber of representative LLMs.\\nThe source of pre-training corpus can be broadly cate-\\ngorized into two types: general data and specialized data.\\nGeneral data, such as webpages, books, and conversational\\ntext, is utilized by most LLMs [55, 56, 90] due to its large,\\ndiverse, and accessible nature, which can enhance the lan-\\nguage modeling and generalization abilities of LLMs. In\\nlight of the impressive generalization capabilities exhibited\\nby LLMs, there are also studies that extend their pre-training\\ncorpus to more specialized datasets, such as multilingual\\ndata, scientific data, and code, endowing LLMs with specific\\ntask-solving capabilities [35, 56, 86]. In what follows, we\\ndescribe these two types of pre-training data sources and\\ntheir effects on LLMs. For a detailed introduction to the\\ncommonly used corpus, one can refer to Section 3.2.\\nGeneral Text Data. As we can see in Figure 6, the vast\\nmajority of LLMs adopt general-purpose pre-training data,\\nsuch as webpages, books, and conversational text, which\\nprovides rich text sources on a variety of topics. Next, we\\nbriefly summarize three important kinds of general data.\\n• Webpages. Owing to the proliferation of the Internet,\\nvarious types of data have been created, which enables\\nLLMs to gain diverse linguistic knowledge and enhance\\ntheir generalization capabilities [26, 82]. For convenient\\nuse of these data resources, a large amount of data is\\ncrawled from the web in previous work, such as Com-\\nmonCrawl [163]. However, the crawled web data tends to\\ncontain both high-quality text, such as Wikipedia and low-\\nquality text, like spam mail, thus it is important to filter and\\nprocess webpages for improving the data quality.\\n• Conversation text. Conversation data can enhance the\\nconversational competence of LLMs [90] and potentially im-\\nprove their performance on a range of question-answering\\ntasks [56]. Researchers can utilize subsets of public conver-\\nsation corpus (e.g., PushShift.io Reddit corpus) [158, 202] or\\ncollect conversation data from online social media. Since on-\\nline conversational data often involves discussions among\\nmultiple participants, an effective processing way is to\\ntransform a conversation into a tree structure, where the\\nutterance is linked to the one it responds to. In this way, the\\nmulti-party conversation tree can be divided into multiple\\nsub-conversations, which can be collected in the pre-training\\ncorpus. Furthermore, a potential risk is that the excessive\\nintegration of dialogue data into LLMs may result in a side\\neffect [90]: declarative instructions and direct interrogatives\\nare erroneously perceived as the beginning of conversations,\\nthus leading to a decline in the efficacy of the instructions.\\n• Books. Compared to other corpus, books provide an\\nimportant source of formal long texts, which are potentially\\nbeneficial for LLMs to learn linguistic knowledge, model\\nlong-term dependency, and generate narrative and coherent\\ntexts. To obtain open-source book data, existing studies\\nusually adopt the Books3 and Bookcorpus2 datasets, which\\nare available in the Pile dataset [161].\\nSpecialized Text Data. Specialized datasets are useful to\\nimprove the specific capabilities of LLMs on downstream\\ntasks. Next, we introduce three kinds of specialized data.\\n• Multilingual text. In addition to the text in the target\\nlanguage, integrating a multilingual corpus can enhance\\nthe multilingual abilities of language understanding and\\ngeneration. For example, BLOOM [78] and PaLM [56] have\\ncurated multilingual data covering 46 and 122 languages,\\nrespectively, within their pre-training corpora. FLM [102]\\nmixes Chinese and English corpora in nearly equal propor-\\ntions. These models demonstrate impressive performance in\\nmultilingual tasks, such as translation, multilingual summa-\\nrization, and multilingual question answering, and achieve\\ncomparable or superior performance to the state-of-the-\\nart models that are fine-tuned on the corpus in the target\\nlanguage(s).'),\n",

The exploration of science by humans has\\nbeen witnessed by the increasing growth of scientific publi-\\ncations. In order to enhance the understanding of scientific\\nknowledge for LLMs [35, 203], it is useful to incorporate a\\nscientific corpus for model pre-training [35, 203]. By pre-\\ntraining on a vast amount of scientific text, LLMs can\\nachieve impressive performance in scientific and reasoning\\ntasks [204]. To construct the scientific corpus, existing efforts\\nmainly collect arXiv papers, scientific textbooks, math web-\\npages, and other related scientific resources. Due to the com-\\nplex nature of data in scientific fields, such as mathematical\\nsymbols and protein sequences, specific tokenization and\\npreprocessing techniques are usually required to transform\\nthese different formats of data into a unified form that can\\nbe processed by language models.\\n• Code. Program synthesis has been widely studied in\\nthe research community [105, 205–208], especially the use of\\nPLMs trained on code [165, 209]. However, it remains chal-\\nlenging for these PLMs ( e.g., GPT-J [165]) to generate high-\\nquality and accurate programs. Recent studies [105, 208]\\nhave found that training LLMs on a vast code corpus\\ncan lead to a substantial improvement in the quality of\\nthe synthesized programs. The generated programs can\\nsuccessfully pass expert-designed unit-test cases [105] or\\nsolve competitive programming questions [114]. In gen-\\neral, two types of code corpora are commonly used for\\npre-training LLMs. The first source is from programming\\nquestion answering communities like Stack Exchange [210].\\nThe second source is from public software repositories\\nsuch as GitHub [86, 105, 208], where code data (includ-\\ning comments and docstrings) are collected for utilization.\\nCompared to natural language text, code is in the format\\nof a programming language, corresponding to long-range\\ndependencies and accurate execution logic [211]. A recent\\nstudy [47] also speculates that training on code might be a\\nsource of complex reasoning abilities ( e.g., chain-of-thought\\nability [33]). Furthermore, it has been shown that formatting\\nreasoning tasks into code can help LLMs generate more\\naccurate results [211].\\n4.1.2 Data Preprocessing\\nAfter collecting a large amount of text data, it is essential\\nto preprocess the data for constructing the pre-training\\ncorpus, especially removing noisy, redundant, irrelevant,\\nand potentially toxic data [56, 64, 212], which may largely\\naffect the capacity and performance of LLMs. To facilitate\\nthe data processing, a recent study [213] proposes a useful\\ndata processing system for LLMs, named Data-Juicer, which\\nprovides over 50 processing operators and tools. In this\\npart, we review the detailed data preprocessing strategies\\nto improve the quality of the collected data [64, 78, 112]. A\\ntypical pipeline of preprocessing the pre-training data for\\nLLMs has been illustrated in Figure 7.\\nQuality Filtering. To remove low-quality data from the\\ncollected corpus, existing work generally adopts two ap-\\nproaches: (1) classifier-based, and (2) heuristic-based. The\\nformer approach trains a selection classifier based on high-\\nquality texts and leverages it to identify and filter out low-\\nquality data. Typically, these methods [55, 56, 112] train\\na binary classifier with well-curated data ( e.g., Wikipedia\\npages) as positive instances and sample candidate data\\nas negative instances, and predict the score that measures\\nthe quality of each data example. However, several stud-\\nies [64, 112] find that a classifier-based approach may result\\nin the unintentional removal of high-quality texts in dialec-\\ntal, colloquial, and sociolectal languages, which potentially\\nleads to bias in the pre-training corpus and diminishes the\\ncorpus diversity. As the second approach, several studies,\\nsuch as BLOOM [78] and Gopher [64], employ heuristic-\\nbased approaches to eliminate low-quality texts through a\\nset of well-designed rules, which can be summarized as\\nfollows:\\n• Language based filtering. If a LLM would be mainly used\\nin the tasks of certain languages, the text in other lan-\\nguages can be filtered.\\n• Metric based filtering. Evaluation metrics about the gener-\\nated texts, e.g., perplexity, can be employed to detect and\\nremove unnatural sentences.\\n• Statistic based filtering. Statistical features of a corpus,\\ne.g., the punctuation distribution, symbol-to-word ratio,\\nand sentence length, can be utilized to measure the text\\nquality and filter the low-quality data.\\n• Keyword based filtering. Based on specific keyword set, the\\nnoisy or unuseful elements in the text, such as HTML\\ntags, hyperlinks, boilerplates, and offensive words, can\\nbe identified and removed.\\nDe-duplication. Existing work [214] has found that dupli-\\ncate data in a corpus would reduce the diversity of language\\nmodels, which may cause the training process to become un-\\nstable and thus affect the model performance. Therefore, it is\\nnecessary to de-duplicate the pre-training corpus. Specially,\\nde-duplication can be performed at different granularities,\\nincluding sentence-level, document-level, and dataset-level\\nde-duplication. First, low-quality sentences that contain re-\\npeated words and phrases should be removed, as they may\\nintroduce repetitive patterns in language modeling [215].\\nAt the document level, existing studies mostly rely on the\\noverlap ratio of surface features ( e.g., words and n-grams\\noverlap) between documents to detect and remove duplicate\\ndocuments containing similar contents [57, 64, 78, 216].\\nFurthermore, to avoid the dataset contamination problem,\\nit is also crucial to prevent the overlap between the training\\nand evaluation sets [56], by removing the possible duplicate\\ntexts from the training set. It has been shown that the three\\nlevels of de-duplication are useful to improve the training\\nof LLMs [56, 217], which should be jointly used in practice.\\nPrivacy Reduction. The majority of pre-training text data is\\nobtained from web sources, including user-generated con-\\ntent involving sensitive or personal information, which may\\nincrease the risk of privacy breaches [218]. Thus, it is nec-\\nessary to remove the personally identifiable information (PII)\\nfrom the pre-training corpus. One direct and effective ap-\\nproach is to employ rule-based methods, such as keyword\\nspotting, to detect and remove PII such as names, addresses,\\nand phone numbers [162]. Furthermore, researchers also\\nfind that the vulnerability of LLMs under privacy attacks\\ncan be attributed to the presence of duplicate PII data in the\\npre-training corpus [219]. Therefore, de-duplication can also'),\n",

Tokenization is also a crucial step for data\\npreprocessing. It aims to segment raw text into sequences\\nof individual tokens, which are subsequently used as the\\ninputs of LLMs. In traditional NLP research ( e.g., sequence\\nlabeling with conditional random fields [220]), word-based\\ntokenization is the predominant approach, which is more\\naligned with human’s language cognition. However, word-\\nbased tokenization can yield different segmentation results\\nfor the same input in some languages ( e.g., Chinese word\\nsegmentation), generate a huge word vocabulary containing\\nmany low-frequency words, and also suffer from the “ out-\\nof-vocabulary” issue. Thus, several neural network models\\nemploy character as the minimum unit to derive the word\\nrepresentation ( e.g., a CNN word encoder in ELMo [21]).\\nRecently, subword tokenizers have been widely used in Trans-\\nformer based language models, typically including Byte-\\nPair Encoding tokenization, WordPiece tokenization and\\nUnigram tokenization. HuggingFace has maintained an\\nexcellent online NLP course on tokenizer 22 with running\\nexamples, and we refer to the beginners to this course. Next,\\nwe briefly describe the three representative tokenization\\nmethods.\\n• Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization . BPE was origi-\\nnally proposed as a general data compression algorithm in\\n1994 [221], and then adapted to NLP for tokenization [222].\\nIt starts with a set of basic symbols ( e.g., the alphabets\\nand boundary characters), and iteratively combine frequent\\npairs of two consecutive tokens in the corpus as new to-\\nkens (called merge). For each merge, the selection criterion\\nis based on the co-occurrence frequency of two contigu-\\nous tokens: the top frequent pair would be selected. The\\nmerge process continues until it reaches the predefined\\nsize. Further, Byte-level BPE has been used to improve the\\ntokenization quality for multilingual corpus ( e.g., the text\\ncontaining non-ASCII characters) by considering bytes as the\\nbasic symbols for merge. Representative language models\\nwith this tokenization approach include GPT-2, BART, and\\nLLaMA.\\n• WordPiece tokenization. WordPiece was a Google inter-\\nnal subword tokenization algorithm. It was originally pro-\\nposed by Google in developing voice search systems [223].\\nThen, it was used in the neural machine translation system\\nin 2016 [224], and was adopted as the word tokenizer for\\nBERT in 2018 [23]. WordPiece has a very similar idea with\\nBPE by iteratively merging consecutive tokens, whereas\\n22. https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter6\\ntaking a slightly different selection criterion for the merge.\\nTo conduct the merge, it first trains a language model and\\nemploys it to score all possible pairs. Then, at each merge, it\\nselects the pair that leads to the most increase in the likeli-\\nhood of training data. Since Google has’t released the official\\nimplementation of the WordPiece algorithm, HuggingFace\\ngives a more intuitive selection measure in its online NLP\\ncourse: a pair is scored by dividing the co-occurrence count\\nby the product of the occurrence counts of two tokens in the\\npair based on training corpus.\\n• Unigram tokenization. Unlike BPE and WordPiece, Un-\\nigram tokenization [225] starts with a sufficiently large\\nset of possible substrings or subtokens for a corpus, and\\niteratively removes the tokens in the current vocabulary\\nuntil the expected vocabulary size is reached. As the se-\\nlection criterion, it calculates the yielded increase in the\\nlikelihood of training corpus by assuming that some to-\\nken was removed from current vocabulary. This step is\\nconducted based on a trained unigram language model.\\nTo estimate the unigram language model, it adopts an\\nexpectation–maximization (EM) algorithm: at each iteration,\\nwe first find the currently optimal tokenization of words\\nbased on the old language model, and then re-estimate the\\nprobabilities of unigrams to update the language model.\\nDuring this procedure, dynamic programming algorithms\\n(i.e., the Viterbi algorithm) are used to efficiently find the\\noptimal decomposition way of a word given the language\\nmodel. Representative models that adopt this tokenization\\napproach include T5 and mBART.\\nAlthough it is expedient to leverage an existing tokenizer\\n(e.g., OPT [90] and GPT-3 [55] utilize the tokenizer of GPT-\\n2 [26]), using a tokenizer specially designed for the pre-\\ntraining corpus can be highly beneficial [78], especially for\\nthe corpus that consists of diverse domains, languages, and\\nformats. Therefore, recent LLMs often train the customized\\ntokenizers specially for the pre-training corpus with the\\nSentencePiece library [226], which includes Byte-level BPE\\nand Unigram tokenization. A note is that normalization\\ntechniques in BPE, such as NFKC [227], may degrade the\\ntokenization performance [34, 64, 78]. When extending\\nexisting LLMs ( i.e., continual pre-training or instruction\\ntuning), we should be also aware of the potential side effect\\nwith customized tokenizers. For example, LLaMA trains\\nthe BPE tokenizer based on a pre-training corpus mainly\\nconsisting of English texts, and the derived vocabulary\\nmight be less capable in processing non-English data, e.g.,\\ntaking longer inference latency to generate Chinese texts.\"),\n",

For pre-training, the\\nquality of pre-training data is vital to the model capacities\\nof LLMs. Existing work has shown that pre-training on the\\nlow-quality corpus, such as noisy, toxic, and duplicate data,\\nwould largely hurt the performance of models [64, 214,\\n216, 219]. Recent studies, such as T5 [82], GLaM [112], and\\nGopher [64], have investigated the influence of data quality\\non the LLMs’ capacities. By comparing the performance of\\nmodels trained on the filtered and unfiltered corpus, they\\nhave reached the similar conclusion that pre-training LLMs\\non cleaned data can improve the model performance. More\\nspecifically, the duplication of data may result in “ double\\ndescent” (referring to the phenomenon of performance ini-\\ntially deteriorating and subsequently improving) [214, 228],\\nor even overwhelm the training process [214]. In addition,\\nit has been shown that duplicate data degrades the ability\\nof LLMs to copy from the context, which might further\\naffect the generalization capacity of LLMs using in-context\\nlearning [214]. Therefore, as suggested in [56, 64, 78, 212],\\nit is essential to utilize preprocessing methods like quality\\nfiltering, toxic filtering and deduplication to carefully clean\\nthe pre-training corpus (as illustrated in Section 4.1.2), to\\nimprove stability of the training process and avoid affecting\\nthe model performance.\\n4.1.3 Data Scheduling\\nAfter data preprocessing, it is essential to design suit-\\nable strategies to schedule these multi-source data for pre-\\ntraining a capable LLM. Generally, two key aspects should\\nbe paid close attention for data scheduling: the proportion\\nof each data source ( data mixture), and the order in which\\neach data source is scheduled for training ( data curriculum).\\nNext, we discuss the two aspects in detail. An illustration of\\ndata scheduling has been presented in Figure 8.\\nData Mixture. Since each kind of data source is closely\\nrelated to the development of certain capacities for LLMs\\n(referring to the discussions in Section 4.1), it is important\\nto set a suitable distribution to mix these data. The data\\nmixture is generally set in a global level (i.e., the distribution\\nof the entire pre-training data), and can be also locally set\\nto varied proportions at different training stages. During\\npre-training, data samples from different sources would be\\nselected according to the mixture proportions: more data\\nwill be sampled from a data source with a larger weight.\\nTypically, existing LLMs such as LLaMA [57] may employ\\nupsampling or downsampling on the full data of each\\nsource to create specific data mixtures as pre-training data.\\nAs Figure 6 illustrates, existing LLMs use different data mix-\\ntures to construct the pre-training data. As a representative\\nmodel, the pre-training data of LLaMA [57] mainly consists\\nof webpages (over 80%), alongside 6.5% of code-heavy data\\nfrom GitHub and StackExchange, 4.5% from books, and\\n2.5% of scientific data sourced from arXiv, which has become\\nan important reference for training general-purpose LLMs.\\nFurthermore, special data mixtures can be used to facilitate\\ndifferent purposes. For example, Falcon [141] is trained on\\npure webpages, and CodeGen [86] largely increases the\\namount of code data. In practice, data mixture is often de-\\ntermined empirically, and we summarize several common\\nstrategies for finding an effective data mixture as follows:\\n• Increasing the diversity of data sources. Recent studies\\nhave empirically shown that training on excessive data\\nabout a certain domain would degrade the generalization\\ncapability of LLMs on other domains [35, 64]. In contrast,\\nincreasing the data source heterogeneity ( e.g., including\\ndiverse data sources) is critical for improving the down-\\nstream performance of LLMs [212, 229, 230]. To further\\nexamine the effect of different data sources, some studies\\nhave conducted ablation experiments by removing each\\ndata source one by one, and pre-train LLMs with specially\\ncurated datasets [212]. It has been shown that dropping data\\nsources with high heterogeneity ( e.g., webpages) impacts\\nLLM’s abilities more severely than dropping sources with\\nlow heterogeneity (e.g., academic corpus).\\n• Optimizing data mixtures. In addition to manually set-\\nting the data mixtures, several studies have proposed to\\noptimize the data mixtures for improving the model pre-\\ntraining [59, 231]. Given the target downstream tasks, one\\ncan select pre-training data with either higher proximity\\nin the feature space [231] or those that provide positive\\ninfluences on downstream task performance [232]. Further,\\nto reduce the reliance of target tasks, DoReMi [59] first trains\\na small reference model using given initial domain weights,\\nand then trains another small proxy model, upweighting the\\ndomains on which the greatest discrepancies in likelihood\\nbetween the two models are observed. Finally, the learned\\ndomain weights of the proxy model are applied to train\\na much larger LLM. In a more simple way, one can train\\nseveral small language models with different data mixtures,\\nand select the data mixture that leads to the most desir-\\nable performance. However, an assumption made in this\\napproach is, when trained in a similar way, small models\\nwould resemble with large models in model abilities or\\nbehaviors, which may not always hold in practice.\\n• Specializing the targeted abilities. The model capacities\\nof LLMs heavily rely on data selection and mixture, and\\none can boost the proportions of specific data sources to\\nenhance certain model abilities [64, 212]. For example, the\\nmathematical reasoning and coding abilities can be specially\\nenhanced by training with more mathematical texts and\\ncode data, respectively. Furthermore, experimental results\\non the LAMBADA dataset [233] show that increasing the\\nproportion of books data can improve the model capacity in\\ncapturing long-term dependencies from text, and increasing\\nthe proportion of the C4 dataset [82] leads to performance\\nimprovement on the C4 validation dataset [64]. Generally,\\nit is important to identify more implicit relations between'),\n",

To enhance specific skills\\nsuch as mathematics and coding in LLMs, or to develop\\nspecialized LLMs, a practical way is to employ a multi-stage\\ntraining approach, e.g., general and skill-specific data can\\nbe scheduled at two consecutive stages. This approach of\\ntraining LLMs on varying sources or proportions of data\\nacross multiple stages is also known as “data curriculum”,\\nwhich will be introduced below.\\nData Curriculum. After preparing the data mixture, it\\nis important to schedule the order that specific data is\\npresented to LLMs for pre-training. It has been shown that,\\nin some cases, to learn a certain skill, learning in a skill-\\nset sequence ( e.g., basic skills → target skill) outperforms\\ndirect learning from a corpus focused solely on the target\\nskill [234, 235]. Following the idea of curriculum learn-\\ning [236], data curriculum has been proposed and widely\\nused in model pre-training [234, 235, 237, 238]. It aims to\\norganize different parts of pre-training data for LLMs in\\na specific order, e.g., starting with easy/general examples\\nand progressively introducing more challenging/special-\\nized ones. More generally, it can broadly refer to the adap-\\ntive adjustment of data proportions for different sources\\nduring pre-training. Existing work about data curriculum\\nmainly focuses on continual pre-training, such as special-\\nized coding LLMs ( e.g., CodeLLaMA [235]) or long context\\nLLMs ( e.g., LongLLaMA [238]). However, it still lacks of\\nmore detailed report about data curriculum for general-\\npurpose LLMs (e.g., LLaMA) in the literature. To determine\\ndata curriculum, a practical approach is to monitor the de-\\nvelopment of key abilities of LLMs based on specially con-\\nstructed evaluation benchmarks, and then adaptively adjust\\nthe data mixture during pre-training. Next, we take three\\ncommon abilities as examples to introduce how the concept\\nof data curriculum23 applies in continual pre-training.\\n• Coding. To improve the coding ability of LLMs, CodeL-\\nLaMA [235] is developed based on LLaMA 2 [99] (2T general\\ntokens → 500B code-heavy tokens), aiming to improve the\\ncode generation ability and retain natural language under-\\nstanding skills. CodeLLaMA also provides a version that\\nis further specialized to a certain programming language,\\nnamely CodeLLaMA-Python (2T general tokens → 500B\\ncode-heavy tokens → 100B Python-heavy tokens).\\n• Mathematics. Llemma [239] is proposed to enhance\\nthe mathematical capacities of general-purpose LLMs. It\\nis developed based on CodeLLaMA. Although CodeL-\\nLaMA [235] mainly focuses on the coding ability, exper-\\niments have shown that it performs better than its base\\nmodel LLaMA 2 on mathematics benchmarks [239]. Based\\non CodeLLaMA, Llemma is continually trained on mixtures\\nof scientific papers, web data containing mathematical text\\nand code (2T general tokens → 500B code-heavy tokens\\n→ 50∼200B math-heavy tokens). Note that the pre-training\\ndata of Llemma also contains 5% general domain data as a\\nform of regularization.\\n• Long context . Long context modeling is an important\\nability for LLMs, and many studies have explored extend-\\n23. We utilize the symbol “ →” to represent the data order in data\\ncurriculum. For example, “2T webpage tokens → 500B code tokens”\\nmeans that the LLM is firstly trained with 2T webpage tokens and\\nsubsequently with 500B code data tokens.\\ning the context windows of LLMs via continually train-\\ning [235, 238]. With modifications on position embeddings\\n(i.e., position interpolation) of RoPE-based LLMs [57, 99,\\n240], CodeLLaMA further extends the context window of\\nLLaMA 2 (2.5T tokens with 4K context window → 20B\\ntokens with 16K context window). LongLLaMA [238] also\\nachieves longer context window with the help of external\\nmemory and a unique training objective (1T tokens with 2K\\ncontext window → 10B tokens with 8K context window).\\n4.1.4 Summary of Data Preparation\\nIn this part, we summarize the general procedure and key\\npoints to prepare pre-training data for LLMs, which are\\ndetailed in the following three aspects.\\n• Data collection. It is suggested to include diverse data\\nsources in the pre-training data. Although Falcon [141]\\nshows that webpages alone can be employed to train power-\\nful LLMs, a more typical approach is to also incorporate di-\\nverse high-quality text like code, books, scientific papers,etc.\\nIf a LLM is specialized with a certain skill, the proportion of\\ncorresponding data source should be increased accordingly.\\nFor example, Gopher [64] and Chinchilla [34] are trained\\nwith approximately 40% of data from books. PaLM [44] and\\nLaMDA [68] use approximately 50% conversational data.\\n• Data cleaning. After data collection, it is crucial to clean\\nthe raw corpus to enhance its quality as possible. First,\\ndeduplication is commonly used in existing work [99, 141,\\n229]. Second, low-quality text, toxic content, and data with\\nprivacy concerns should be removed at different granulari-\\nties (e.g., document, passage or sentence). In practice, both\\nheuristic and classifier-based methods can be employed\\nfor quality and toxicity filtering ( e.g., CCNet [241], fast-\\nText [242], and Data-Juicer [243]). Third, with the cleaned\\ndata, one can further unify or specify the format for pre-\\ntraining data, and perform the tokenization by training\\nthe tokenizer on the filtered and deduplicated corpus with\\nlibraries like SentencePiece [226].\\n• Data scheduling. With the preprocessed data, the next\\nstep is to determine the data mixture and the specific order\\nof data for pre-training LLMs. To determine both settings, a\\npractical way is to first train several small language models\\nwith multiple candidate plans and then select a good plan\\namong them [59]. Overall, it is more difficult to find a\\nsuitable data curriculum. In practice, one can monitor the\\nperformance of intermediate model checkpoints on specific\\nevaluation benchmarks, and dynamically tune the data mix-\\nture and distribution during pre-training. In this process, it\\nis also useful to explore the potential relations between data\\nsources and model abilities to instruct the design of data\\ncurriculum.\\n4.2 Architecture\\nIn this section, we review the architecture design of LLMs,\\ni.e., mainstream architecture, pre-training objective, and de-\\ntailed configuration. Table 5 presents the model cards of\\nseveral representative LLMs with public details.\\n4.2.1 Typical Architectures\\nDue to the excellent parallelizability and capacity, the Trans-\\nformer architecture [22] has become the de facto backbone to'),\n",

The vanilla Transformer\\nmodel is built on the encoder-decoder architecture [22],\\nwhich consists of two stacks of Transformer blocks as\\nthe encoder and decoder, respectively.

We\\nleave a detailed discussion about the architecture selection\\nin Section 4.2.6.\\nCausal Decoder Architecture. The causal decoder archi-\\ntecture incorporates the unidirectional attention mask, to\\nguarantee that each input token can only attend to the\\npast tokens and itself. The input and output tokens are\\nprocessed in the same fashion through the decoder. As\\nrepresentative language models of this architecture, the\\nGPT-series models [26, 55, 122] are developed based on\\nthe causal-decoder architecture.

When mentioning “decoder-\\nonly architecture”, it mainly refers to the causal decoder\\narchitecture in existing literature, unless specified.\\nPrefix Decoder Architecture. The prefix decoder architec-\\nture ( a.k.a., non-causal decoder [244]) revises the masking\\nmechanism of causal decoders, to enable performing bidi-\\nrectional attention over the prefix tokens [245] and unidi-\\nrectional attention only on generated tokens. In this way,\\nlike the encoder-decoder architecture, the prefix decoders\\ncan bidirectionally encode the prefix sequence and autore-\\ngressively predict the output tokens one by one, where the\\nsame parameters are shared during encoding and decoding.\\nInstead of pre-training from scratch, a practical suggestion\\nis to continually train causal decoders and then convert\\nthem into prefix decoders for accelerating convergence [29],\\ne.g., U-PaLM [118] is derived from PaLM [56]. Existing rep-\\nresentative LLMs based on prefix decoders include GLM-\\n130B [93] and U-PaLM [118].\\nMixture-of-Experts. For the above three types of archi-\\ntectures, we can further extend them via the mixture-of-\\nexperts (MoE) scaling, in which a subset of neural network\\nweights for each input are sparsely activated, e.g., Switch\\nTransformer [25] and GLaM [112]. The major merit is that\\nMoE is a flexible way to scale up the model parameter while\\nmaintaining a constant computational cost [25]. It has been\\nshown that substantial performance improvement can be\\nobserved by increasing either the number of experts or the\\ntotal parameter size [246]. Despite the merits, training large\\nMoE models may suffer from instability issues due to the\\ncomplex, hard-switching nature of the routing operation.\\nTo enhance the training stability of MoE-based language\\nmodels, techniques such as selectively using high-precision\\ntensors in the routing module or initializing the model with\\na smaller range have been introduced [25]. More recently,\\nthere is widespread speculation that GPT-4 has been devel-\\noped based on the MoE architecture, but without official\\nverification.\\nEmergent Architectures. The conventional Transformer ar-\\nchitectures typically suffer from quadratic computational\\ncomplexity. Because of this, efficiency has become an im-\\nportant issue when training and making inference with\\nlong inputs. To improve efficiency, some studies aim to\\ndevise new architectures for language modeling, including\\nparameterized state space models ( e.g., S4 [247], GSS [248],\\nand H3 [249]), long convolutions like Hyena [250], and\\nTransformer-like architectures that incorporate recursive up-\\ndate mechanisms ( e.g., RWKV [251] and RetNet [252]). The\\nkey merits of these new architectures are twofold. First,\\nthese models can generate outputs recursively like RNNs,\\nmeaning that they only need to refer to the single previous\\nstate during decoding. It makes the decoding process more\\nefficient as it eliminates the need to revisit all previous\\nstates as in conventional Transformers. Second, these mod-\\nels have the capacity to encode an entire sentence in parallel\\nlike Transformers. This contrasts with conventional RNNs\\nwhich has to encode sentences on a token-by-token basis.\\nThus, they can benefit from the parallelism of GPUs with\\ntechniques such as Parallel Scan [253, 254], FFT [250, 251],\\nand Chunkwise Recurrent [252]. These techniques enable\\nmodels with these new architectures to be trained in a highly\\nparallel and efficient manner.\\n4.2.2 Detailed Configuration\\nSince the launch of Transformer [22], various improvements\\nhave been proposed to enhance its training stability, per-\\nformance, and computational efficiency. In this part, we\\nwill discuss the corresponding configurations for four major\\nparts of the Transformer, including normalization, position\\nembeddings, activation functions, and attention and bias.\\nTo make this survey more self-contained, we present the\\ndetailed formulations for these configurations in Table 6.\\nNormalization Methods. Training instability is a challeng-\\ning issue for pre-training LLMs. To alleviate this issue,\\nnormalization is a widely adopted strategy to stabilize the\\ntraining of neural networks. In the vanilla Transformer [22],\\nLayerNorm [256] is employed. Recently, several advanced\\nnormalization techniques have been proposed as alterna-\\ntives to LayerNorm, e.g., RMSNorm, and DeepNorm.\\n• LayerNorm. In the early research, BatchNorm [265] is\\na commonly used normalization method. However, it is\\ndifficult to deal with sequence data of variable lengths and\\nsmall-batch data. Thus, LayerNorm [256] is introduced to\\nconduct layerwise normalization. Specifically, the mean and\\nvariance over all activations per layer are calculated to re-\\ncenter and re-scale the activations.\\n• RMSNorm. To improve the training speed of Lay-\\nerNorm (LN), RMSNorm [257] is proposed by re-scaling\\nthe activations with only the root mean square (RMS) of\\nthe summed activations, instead of the mean and variance.\\nRelated research has demonstrated its superiority in training\\nspeed and performance on Transformer [266]. Representa-\\ntive models that adopt RMSNorm include Gopher [64] and\\nChinchilla [34].\\n• DeepNorm. DeepNorm is proposed by Microsoft [258]\\nto stabilize the training of deep Transformers. With Deep-\\nNorm as residual connections, Transformers can be scaled\\nup to 1,000 layers [258], which has shown the advantages\\nof stability and good performance. It has been adopted by\\nGLM-130B [93].\\nNormalization Position. In addition to the normalization\\nmethod, normalization position also plays a crucial role in\\nthe LLMs. There are generally three choices for the normal-\\nization position, i.e., post-LN, pre-LN, and sandwich-LN.\\n• Post-LN. Post-LN is used in the vanilla Trans-\\nformer [22], which is placed between residual blocks. How-\\never, existing work has found that the training of Trans-\\nformers with post-LN tends to be instable due to the large\\ngradients near the output layer [267]. Thus, post-LN is rarely\\nemployed in existing LLMs except combined with other\\nstrategies ( e.g., combining post-LN with pre-LN in GLM-\\n130B [93]).\\n• Pre-LN. Different from post-LN, pre-LN [268] is applied\\nbefore each sub-layer, and an additional LN is placed before\\nthe final prediction. Compared with post-LN, the Trans-\\nformers with pre-LN are more stable in training. However,\\nit performs worse than the variants with post-LN [269].\\nDespite the decreasing performance, most LLMs still adopt\\npre-LN due to the training stability. However, one excep-'),\n",

Based on pre-LN, Sandwich-LN [255]\\nadds extra LN before the residual connections to avoid\\nthe value explosion issues in Transformer layer outputs.\\nHowever, it has been found that Sandwich-LN sometimes\\nfails to stabilize the training of LLMs and may lead to the\\ncollapse of training [93].\\nActivation Functions. To obtain good performance, activa-\\ntion functions also need to be properly set in feed-forward\\nnetworks. In existing LLMs, GeLU activations [270] are\\nwidely used. Specially, in the latest LLMs ( e.g., PaLM and\\nLaMDA), variants of GLU activation [262, 271] have also\\nbeen utilized, especially the SwiGLU and GeGLU variants,\\nwhich often achieve better performance in practice [266].\\nHowever, compared with GeLU, they require extra parame-\\nters (about 50%) in the feed-forward networks [272].\\nPosition Embeddings. Since the self-attention modules in\\nTransformer are permutation equivariant, position embed-\\ndings (PE) are employed to inject absolute or relative posi-\\ntion information for modeling sequences.\\n• Absolute position embedding. In the vanilla Trans-\\nformer [22], absolute position embeddings are employed.\\nAt the bottoms of the encoder and the decoder, the absolute\\npositional embeddings are added to the input embeddings.\\nThere are two variants of absolute position embeddings\\nproposed in the vanilla Transformer [22], i.e., sinusoidal and\\nlearned position embeddings, where the latter is commonly\\nused in existing pre-trained language models.\\n• Relative position embedding. Unlike absolute position\\nembeddings, relative positional embeddings are generated\\naccording to the offsets between keys and queries [273].\\nA popular variant of relative PE was introduced in\\nTransformer-XL [274, 275]. The calculation of attention\\nscores between keys and queries has been modified to\\nintroduce learnable embeddings corresponding to relative\\npositions. T5 [82] further simplified relative positional em-\\nbeddings, which was subsequently adopted by Gopher [64].\\nSpecifically, it adds learnable scalars to the attention scores,\\nwhere the scalars are calculated based on the distances\\nbetween the positions of the query and the key. Compared\\nwith the absolute PE, Transformers with relative position\\nembedding can generalize to sequences longer than those\\nsequences for training, i.e., extrapolation [264].\\n• Rotary Position Embedding. Rotary position embedding\\n(RoPE) [263] sets specific rotatory matrices based on the\\nabsolute position of each key or query. The scores between\\nkeys and queries can be computed with relative position\\ninformation (Table 6). RoPE combines each consecutive pair\\nof elements in query and key vectors as a dimension, so there\\nare d/2 dimensions for an original d-length embedding.\\nFor each dimension i ∈ {1, . . . , d/2}, the pair of involved\\nelements will rotate based on the rotation angle t · θi, where\\nt denotes the position index and θi is the basis in the\\ndimension. Following sinusoidal position embeddings [22],\\nRoPE defines the basis θi as an exponentiation of the base b\\n(set to 10000 by default):\\nΘ = {θi = b−2(i−1)/d|i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , d/2}}. (4)\\nFurthermore, a recent study [276] defines the distance re-\\nquired to rotate one cycle ( 2π) for each dimension as wave-\\nlength:\\nλi = 2πb2(i−1)/d = 2π/θi. (5)\\nDue to the excellent performance and the long-term decay\\nproperty, RoPE is widely adopted in the latest LLMs, e.g.,\\nPaLM [56] and LLaMA [57]. Based on RoPE, xPos [277] fur-\\nther improves the translation invariance and length extrap-\\nolation of Transformer. At each dimension of the rotation\\nangle vector, xPos adds a special exponential decay that is\\nsmaller when the basis is larger. It can alleviate the unstable\\nphenomenon during training as the distance increases.\\n• ALiBi. ALiBi [264] is proposed to improve the extrap-\\nolation of Transformer. Similar to relative position embed-\\nding, it biases attention scores with a penalty based on the'),\n",

Different from the rela-\\ntive positional embedding methods like T5 [82], the penalty\\nscores in ALiBi are pre-defined without any trainable pa-\\nrameters. Empirical results in [264] have shown that ALiBi\\nhas a better extrapolation performance on sequences that are\\nlonger than those for training than several popular position\\nembedding methods such as sinusoidal PE [22], RoPE [263],\\nand T5 bias [82]. In addition, it has been shown that ALiBi\\ncan also improve training stability in BLOOM [78].\\nAttention. Attention mechanism is a critical component of\\nTransformer. It allows the tokens across the sequence to\\ninteract with each other and compute the representations\\nof the input and output sequence.\\n• Full attention. In the vanilla Transformer [22], the atten-\\ntion mechanism is conducted in a pairwise way, considering\\nthe relations between all token pairs in a sequence. It adopts\\nscaled dot-product attention, in which the hidden states\\nare mapped into queries, keys, and values. Additionally,\\nTransformer uses multi-head attention instead of single\\nattention, projecting the queries, keys, and values with\\ndifferent projections in different heads. The concatenation\\nof the output of each head is taken as the final output.\\n• Sparse attention . A crucial challenge of full attention\\nis the quadratic computational complexity, which becomes\\na burden when dealing with long sequences. Therefore,\\nvarious efficient Transformer variants are proposed to re-\\nduce the computational complexity of the attention mecha-\\nnism [278, 279]. For instance, locally banded sparse attention\\n(i.e., Factorized Attention [280] has been adopted in GPT-\\n3 [55]. Instead of the whole sequence, each query can only\\nattend to a subset of tokens based on the positions.\\n• Multi-query/grouped-query attention. Multi-query atten-\\ntion refers to the attention variant where different heads\\nshare the same linear transformation matrices on the keys\\nand values [281]. It achieves higher inference speed with\\nonly a minor sacrifice in model quality. Representative\\nmodels with multi-query attention include PaLM [56] and\\nStarCoder [98]. To make a trade-off between multi-query\\nattention and multi-head attention, grouped-query attention\\n(GQA) [282] has been explored. In GQA, heads are assigned\\ninto different groups, and those heads that belong to the\\nsame group will share the same transformation matrices.\\nSpecially, GQA has been adopted and empirically tested in\\nthe recently released LLaMA 2 model [99].\\n• FlashAttention. Different from most existing approx-\\nimate attention methods that trade-off model quality to\\nimprove the computing efficiency, FlashAttention [283] pro-\\nposes to optimize the speed and memory consumption of\\nattention modules on GPUs from an IO-aware perspective.\\nThere exist different levels of memory on modern GPUs,\\ne.g., SRAM with a fast IO and HBM with a relatively\\nslow IO. FlashAttention organizes the input into blocks and\\nintroduces necessary recomputation, both to make better\\nuse of the fast memory SRAM. Implemented as a fused\\nkernel in CUDA, FlashAttention has been integrated into\\nPyTorch [197], DeepSpeed [74], and Megatron-LM [75]. The\\nupdated version FlashAttention-2 [284] further optimizes\\nthe work partitioning of GPU thread blocks and warps, lead-\\ning to around 2 × speedup when compared to the original\\nFlashAttention.\\n• PagedAttention. It has been observed when LLM are\\ndeployed on servers, GPU memory is largely occupied by\\ncached attention key and value tensors (called KV cache ).\\nThe major reason is that the input lengths are often varied,\\nleading to fragmentation and over-reservation issues. In-\\nspired by the classic paging technique in operating systems,\\nPagedAttention has been proposed to improve the memory\\nefficiency and throughput of deployed LLMs [285]. In detail,\\nPagedAttention partitions each sequence into subsequences,\\nand the corresponding KV caches of these subsequences are\\nallocated into non-contiguous physical blocks. The paging\\ntechnique increases the GPU utilization and enables efficient\\nmemory sharing in parallel sampling.\\nTo put all these discussions together, we summarize the\\nsuggestions from existing literature for detailed configura-\\ntion. For stronger generalization and training stability, it is\\nsuggested to choose the pre RMSNorm for layer normaliza-\\ntion, and SwiGLU or GeGLU as the activation function. In\\naddition, LN may not be used immediately after embedding\\nlayers, which is likely to incur performance degradation. As\\nfor position embeddings, RoPE or ALiBi is a better choice\\nsince it performs better on long sequences.\\n4.2.3 Pre-training Tasks\\nPre-training plays a key role that encodes general knowl-\\nedge from large-scale corpus into the massive model param-\\neters. For training LLMs, there are two commonly used pre-\\ntraining tasks, namely language modeling and denoising\\nautoencoding.\\nLanguage Modeling. The language modeling task (LM) is\\nthe most commonly used objective to pre-train decoder-only\\nLLMs, e.g., GPT3 [55] and PaLM [56]. Given a sequence of\\ntokens x = {x1, . . . , xn}, the LM task aims to autoregres-\\nsively predict the target tokens xi based on the preceding\\ntokens x<i in a sequence. A general training objective is to\\nmaximize the following likelihood:\\nLLM (x) =\\nnX\\ni=1\\nlog P(xi|x<i). (6)\\nSince most language tasks can be cast as the prediction\\nproblem based on the input, these decoder-only LLMs might\\nbe potentially advantageous to implicitly learn how to ac-\\ncomplish these tasks in a unified LM way. Some studies\\nhave also revealed that decoder-only LLMs can be naturally\\ntransferred to certain tasks by autoregressively predicting\\nthe next tokens [26, 55], without fine-tuning. An important\\nvariant of LM is the prefix language modeling task, which is\\ndesigned for pre-training models with the prefix decoder\\narchitecture. The tokens within a randomly selected prefix\\nwould not be used in computing the loss of prefix language\\nmodeling. With the same amount of tokens seen during pre-\\ntraining, prefix language modeling performs slightly worse\\nthan language modeling, since fewer tokens in the sequence\\nare involved for model pre-training [29].\\nDenoising Autoencoding. In addition to conventional\\nLM, the denoising autoencoding task (DAE) has also been\\nwidely used to pre-train language models [24, 82]. The\\ninputs x\\\\˜x for DAE task are corrupted text with randomly'),\n",

Then, the language models are trained to re-\\ncover the replaced tokens ˜x. Formally, the training objective\\nof DAE is denoted as follows:\\nLDAE(x) = log P(˜x|x\\\\˜x). (7)\\nHowever, the DAE task seems to be more complicated\\nin implementation than LM task. As a result, it has not\\nbeen widely used to pre-train large language models. Exist-\\ning LLMs that take DAE as pre-training objectives include\\nT5 [82] and GLM-130B [93]. These models are mainly trained\\nto recover the replaced spans in an autoregressive way.\\nMixture-of-Denoisers. Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD) [89],\\nalso known as UL2 loss, was introduced as a unified ob-\\njective for pre-training language models. MoD regards both\\nLM and DAE objectives as different types of denoising tasks,\\nnamely S-denoiser (LM), R-denoiser (DAE, short span and\\nlow corruption), and X-denoiser (DAE, long span or high\\ncorruption). Among the three denoising tasks, S-denoiser\\nis similar to the conventional LM objective (Equation (6)),\\nwhile R-denoiser and X-denoiser are similar to DAE ob-\\njectives (Equation (7)) but differ from each other in the\\nlengths of spans and ratio of corrupted text. For input sen-\\ntences started with different special tokens ( i.e., {[R], [S],\\n[X]}), the model will be optimized using the corresponding\\ndenoisers. MoD has been applied in the latest PaLM 2\\nmodel [120].\\n4.2.4 Long Context Modeling\\nIn real applications, there is an increasing demand for long\\ncontext modeling capacities of LLMs, such as PDF pro-\\ncessing and story writing [286]. Many closed-source LLMs\\nprovide professional support for long text processing. For\\ninstance, OpenAI releases GPT-4 Turbo with a 128K context\\nwindow, and Anthropic releases Claude 2.1 with a 200K\\ncontext window. To enhance the long context modeling\\nabilities, there are generally two feasible directions, namely\\nscaling position embeddings and adapting context window.\\nNext, we introduce the two parts in detail.\\nScaling Position Embeddings. Transformer-based LLMs\\ncan learn effective position embeddings within the maxi-\\nmum training length. Thus, when adapting LLMs to lan-\\nguage tasks beyond the maximum training length, it is\\nnecessary to scale to larger position indices. Some specific\\nposition embeddings have been shown to possess a certain\\ndegree of ability to generalize to text beyond the training\\nlength, which is formally termed extrapolation capability ,\\nincluding T5 bias [82], ALiBi [264], xPos [277] and even\\nNoPE [287]. However, as one of the mainstream position\\nembedding methods, RoPE exhibits limited extrapolation\\nability in empirical studies [240]. In the following, we dis-\\ncuss several methods that can scale RoPE to longer texts.\\n• Direct model fine-tuning. To adapt LLMs to a long con-\\ntext window, a straightforward approach is to directly fine-\\ntune the models on long texts with the desired length. The\\ncontext extension can be scheduled with increased lengths\\nin a multi-stage approach (e.g., 2K → 8K → 32K). To conduct\\neffective extension, it needs specially prepared long texts\\nfor training. Specially, some recent study has shown that\\nthe quality is more important than the lengths of training\\ntext in long context models [288]. However, a recent study\\nhas highlighted that the fine-tuning approach tends to be\\ninherently slow when adapting LLMs for long texts [240].\\n• Position interpolation. This method downscales the po-\\nsition indices within the original context window, to avoid\\nout-of-distribution rotation angles during pre-training [240,\\n289]. To be more specific, this approach multiplies all posi-\\ntion indices by a coefficient L/L′ (L < L′), where L and\\nL′ represent the original and target context window length,\\nrespectively. Experimental results [240] have shown that\\nthis method can extend the context window effectively and\\nefficiently, compared to the above approach of direct model\\nfine-tuning. However, it is worth noting that this technique\\nmay have an adverse impact on the model’s performance\\nwhen handling shorter texts[240, 290].\\n• Position truncation. To mitigate the challenges posed\\nby out-of-distribution rotation angles, another practical ap-\\nproach is to truncate longer relative positions to satisfy the\\nrequirement of the maximum training length. Specifically,\\nReRoPE and LeakyReRoPE [291] introduce a pre-defined\\nwindow length, which is smaller than the maximum train-\\ning length. Position indices within this pre-defined window\\nare retained, while those indices beyond the window are\\neither truncated to the pre-defined window length or in-\\nterpolated to align with the maximum training length. This\\nstrategy can reserve local position relationships and enhance\\nthe extrapolation capacity. However, this approach needs\\nto compute the attention matrices twice, accommodating\\nadditional computational budget.\\n• Base modification. LLMs are usually trained with a pre-\\nset maximum training length, e.g., 4096 in Llama 2 [99].\\nHowever, wavelengths in certain dimensions of RoPE may\\nexceed the training length for longer text [276], so that\\nlanguage models have not undergone sufficient training\\n(i.e., a complete rotation cycle) on these dimensions. Thus,\\nwhen we adapt LLMs to longer texts, the rotation angles\\nfor certain dimensions would be never seen in the training\\nphase [292]. Given a fixed rotation angle t·θi, a smaller basis\\nθi allows for a greater distance t, i.e., enabling the modeling\\nof longer texts [235, 276, 288]. According to the formula\\nθi = b−2(i−1)/d in Equation 4, decreasing the basis can be\\nachieved by increasing the value of the base. In addition,\\ndecreasing the base can also help re-scale the wavelengths\\nof all dimensions below the training length, while it often\\nneeds continual pre-training to adapt the LLMs to long\\ncontext windows [292]. A recent study [292] has empirically\\ncompared these two base modification methods, and shown\\nthat decreasing the base demonstrates a better extrapolation'),\n",

Similar to the base modification, the\\ntruncation of the basis also concentrates on dealing with\\nthe singular dimensions with wavelengths exceeding the\\ntraining length [293]. According to the definition λi = 2π/θi\\nin Equation 5, the dimension with a large wavelength λi\\nhas a small basis θi accordingly. Based on this observation,\\nthis approach first defines a basis range [a, c]. Given the\\nbasis range, the value of basis is modified according to the\\nfollowing ways: (1) when θi ≥ c, the value is retained,\\n(2) when θi ≤ a, the value is set to zero, and (3) when\\na < θ i < c, the value is truncated to a fixed small\\nvalue. Via basis truncation, the out-of-distribution rotation\\nangles can be avoided at larger position indices. However,\\nthis approach does not perform very well at long context\\ntasks [293].\\nAdapting Context Window. Since Transformer-based LLMs\\nhave limited context windows, they can not directly inte-\\ngrate or utilize the entire information of the long sequences\\nexceeding the context window. To alleviate the limitation,\\nseveral methods adapting LLMs to long context have been\\nproposed, as discussed below.\\n• Parallel context window. Inspired by fusion-in-\\ndecoder [294], parallel context window methods [295, 296]\\nadopt a divide-and-conquer strategy to process input text.\\nSpecially, it divides the input text into multiple segments,\\neach independently encoded with shared position embed-\\ndings. In the generation stage, the attention masks are mod-\\nified to make that subsequent tokens can access to previous\\ntokens in each segment. Nevertheless, this method cannot\\ndistinguish the order of different segments, constraining the\\nmodel capacity on certain tasks.\\n• Λ-shaped context window. Some prior work has revealed\\nthat LLMs tend to allocate greater attention weights to\\nthe starting and nearest tokens among all previous to-\\nkens [297, 298], so called the “ lost in the middle ” phe-\\nnomenon [299]. Based on this observation, LM-Infinite [300]\\nand StreamingLLM [298] propose to employ a “ Λ-shaped”\\nattention mask, which selectively preserves the initial tokens\\nand the nearest tokens that each query can attend to and\\nthen discards any tokens beyond this scope. Experiments\\ndemonstrate that this method can facilitate extra-long text\\ngeneration with a fixed memory [298]. However, it may\\nstruggle to model the long-range dependency in prompts,\\nsince it cannot effectively utilize the information from the\\ndiscarded tokens [298].\\n• External memory. It has been shown that a relatively\\nsmall subset of tokens can effectively capture the majority\\nof attention patterns in a Transformer [301], i.e., the top-\\nk attention keys can well approximate the original full\\nattention. Therefore, a number of studies propose to store\\nthe past keys in external memory and utilize a k-NN\\nsearch method to retrieve the k most relevant tokens for\\ngeneration [238, 301, 302]. For a decoder model, it typically\\nemploys one certain layer to access these top- k external\\ntokens, while still adopts the normal context window in the\\nrest layers [238, 302].\\nIn addition to the studies based on vanilla Transformer,\\nthere are a surge of Transformer variants with efficient at-\\ntentions and other efficient architectures, aiming to alleviate\\nhigh computational cost for modeling long texts. These\\nstudies have been extensively discussed in Section 4.2.1\\nand Section 4.2.2. Furthermore, context compression and\\nprompting techniques ( e.g., iterative reasoning [303]) have\\nalso been proven to be a viable strategy for handling long\\ntext tasks [303–306], without the need of model adaption.\\n4.2.5 Decoding Strategy\\nAfter the LLMs have been pre-trained, it is essential to em-\\nploy a specific decoding strategy to generate the appropriate\\noutput from the LLMs.\\nBackground. We start the discussion with the prevalent\\ndecoder-only architecture, and introduce the auto-regressive\\ndecoding mechanism. Since such LLMs are pre-trained\\nbased on the language modeling task (Equation 6), a basic\\ndecoding method is greedy search that predicts the most\\nlikely token at each step based on the previously generated\\ntokens, formally modeled as:\\nxi = arg max\\nx\\nP(x|x<i), (8)\\nwhere xi is the token with the highest probability at i-\\nth step of generation conditioned on the context x<i. For\\ninstance in Figure 10, when predicting the next token of\\nthe sentence “I am sleepy. I start a pot of” , greedy search\\nselects the token “coffee” which has the highest probability\\nat the current step. Greedy search can achieve satisfactory\\nresults in text generation tasks ( e.g., machine translation\\nand text summarization), in which the output is highly\\ndependent on the input [307]. However, in terms of open-\\nended generation tasks ( e.g., story generation and dialog),\\ngreedy search sometimes tends to generate awkward and\\nrepetitive sentences [308].\\nAs another alternative decoding strategy, sampling-\\nbased methods are proposed to randomly select the next\\ntoken based on the probability distribution to enhance the\\nrandomness and diversity during generation:\\nxi ∼ P(x|x<i). (9)\\nFor the example in Figure 10, sampling-based methods will\\nsample the word “coffee” with higher probability while\\nalso retaining the possibilities of selecting the rest words,\\n“water”, “tea”, “rice”, etc.\\nNot limited to the decoder-only architecture, these two\\ndecoding methods can be generally applied to encoder-\\ndecoder models and prefix decoder models in a similar way.\\nImprovement for Greedy Search. Selecting the token with\\nthe highest probability at each step may result in overlook-\\ning a sentence with a higher overall probability but a lower\\nlocal estimation. Next, we introduce several improvement\\nstrategies to alleviate this issue.\\n• Beam search. Beam search [309] retains the sentences\\nwith the n (beam size) highest probabilities at each step\\nduring the decoding process, and finally selects the gener-\\nated response with the top probability. Typically, the beam\\nsize is configured within the range of 3 to 6. However,\\nopting for a larger beam size might result in a decline in\\nperformance [310].'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2023-11-27T01:44:56+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2023-11-27T01:44:56+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\2303.18223.pdf', 'total_pages': 124, 'page': 27, 'page_label': '28'}, page_content='28\\n• Length penalty. Since beam search favours shorter sen-\\ntences, imposing length penalty ( a.k.a., length normaliza-\\ntion) is a commonly used technique [311] to overcome this\\nissue, which normalizes the sentence probability according\\nto the sentence length (divided by an exponential power α\\nof the length).\\nBesides, some researchers [312] propose to penalize the\\ngeneration of previously generated tokens or n-grams to\\nalleviate the issue of repetitive generation. In addition,\\ndiverse beam search [313] can be leveraged to produce a\\nset of diverse outputs based on the same input.\\nImprovement for Random Sampling. Sampling-based\\nmethods sample the token over the whole vocabulary, which\\nmay select wrong or irrelevant tokens ( e.g., “happy” and\\n“Boh” in Figure 10) based on the context. To improve the\\ngeneration quality, several strategies have been proposed\\nfor mitigating or preventing the selection of words with\\nexceedingly low probabilities.\\n• Temperature sampling. To modulate the randomness of\\nsampling, a practical method is to adjust the temperature\\ncoefficient of the softmax function for computing the proba-\\nbility of the j-th token over the vocabulary:\\nP(xj|x<i) = exp (lj/t)P\\nj′ exp (lj′ /t), (10)\\nwhere lj′ is the logits of each word and t is the temperature\\ncoefficient. Reducing the temperature t increases the chance\\nof selecting words with high probabilities while decreases\\nthe chances of selecting words with low probabilities. When\\nt is set to 1, it becomes the default random sampling; when\\nt is approaching 0, it is equivalent to greedy search. In\\naddition, when t goes to infinity, it degenerates to uniform\\nsampling.\\n• Top-k sampling. Different from temperature sampling,\\ntop-k sampling directly truncates the tokens with lower\\nprobability and only samples from the tokens with the top\\nk highest probabilities [314]. For example in Figure 10, top-\\n5 sampling will sample from the words “coffee”, “water”,\\n“tea”, “rice”, and “chai” from their re-scaled probabilities.\\n• Top-p sampling. Since top-k sampling does not consider\\nthe overall possibility distribution, a constant value ofk may\\nbe not be suitable for different contexts. Therefore, top- p\\nsampling (a.k.a., nucleus sampling) is proposed by sampling\\nfrom the smallest set having a cumulative probability above\\n(or equal to) p [308]. In practice, the smallest set can be con-\\nstructed by gradually adding tokens from the vocabulary\\nsorted in descending order of generative probability, until\\ntheir cumulative value exceeds p.\\nRecently, researchers have also explored other sampling\\nstrategies for LLMs. For instance, η-sampling [315] further\\nimproves top-p sampling by introducing a dynamic thresh-\\nold based on the probability distribution. Furthermore, con-\\ntrastive search [316] and typical sampling [317] can be utilized\\nto improve the generation coherence during decoding. Since\\nit has been found that large models tend to assign higher\\nprobability to important tokens compared to small models,\\ncontrastive decoding [318] utilizes a larger LM ( e.g., OPT-\\n13B) and a smaller LM ( e.g., OPT-125M) to measure their\\nlog-likelihood differences. Subsequently, tokens are sampled\\nbased on the delta value of the probability distribution,\\nthereby amplifying the impact of important tokens. Based\\non this contrastive idea, DoLa [319] further extends this\\napproach to contrasting the logits across different layers of\\na single LLM, as higher layers tend to assign more weight\\nto important tokens.\\nMemory Wall\\nWhen generating a new token, the most time-\\nconsuming steps revolve around data transfer and\\nweight computation. A main issue is the significant\\namount of time overwhelmed by data transfer, of-\\nten referred to as the memory wall issue.\\nTo address this issue, researchers formally quantify\\ndata transfer from GPU memory to GPU caches\\nusing the number of bytes in I/O, and they assess\\nweight computation by measuring the number of\\nFLOPs [320]. Specifically, let b, s, n, d, and h denote\\nthe batch size, sequence length, number of attention\\nheads, hidden size of each head, and overall hidden\\nsize ( h = n · d), respectively. During the layer-\\nwise multi-head self-attention calculation in causal\\ndecoder, the I/O bytes and FLOPs at each decoding\\nstep can be expressed as 8bsn + 4bsnd + 4bnd and\\n8bsnd, respectively [320].\\nArithmetic intensity is further defined as the ratio of\\nFLOPs to I/O bytes:\\nintensity = FLOPs\\nI/O bytes = 2\\n1 + 2\\nd + 1\\ns\\n(11)\\nLet’s consider LLaMA 13B ( d = 128 ) with a se-\\nquence length of 1024 ( s = 1024 ) as an example.\\nThe calculated arithmetic intensity is 1.97. How-\\never, the A100 80G GPU can perform 312 TFLOPs\\nand transfer 2 TB of data in one second, i.e., its ideal\\narithmetic intensity is 156. This indicates that the\\nbottleneck in attention calculation lies in the process\\nof data transfer (i.e., excessive I/O loading).\\nDecoding Efficiency Issues. In this part, we briefly ana-\\nlyze the decoding efficiency issues of LLMs. Overall, the\\ndecoding process of LLMs can be divided into two stages\\nfor overhead analysis: (1) the prefill stage, which computes\\nthe hidden states of the input sequence, and (2) the incre-\\nmental decoding stage, which generates a token and updates\\nhidden states in an auto-regressive manner [321]. As shown\\nin the above memory wall box, the arithmetic intensity of\\nthe incremental decoding stage is only 1.97, which is far\\nfrom the expected value of 156 (calculated according to\\nthe standard configuration of A100 80GB GPU). In contrast,\\nthe arithmetic intensity of the prefill stage achieves 113.78\\nfor LLaMA-13B. Consequently, existing work mainly inves-\\ntigates how to enhance the efficiency of the incremental\\ndecoding algorithm, which can be categorized into two\\nmain approaches:\\n• Reducing data transfer mainly focuses on optimizing\\nGPU memory access, thereby increasing the arithmetic in-\\ntensity. As introduced in Section 4.2.2, KV cache can avoid\\nredundant computation of previous tokens and PagedAt-'),\n",

Furthermore, Flash-Decoding [322]\\nspeeds up attention computation by loading the keys and\\nvalues in parallel, especially effective for long text gen-\\neration. As another alternative approach, multi-query and\\ngrouped-query attention can reduce the GPU memory band-\\nwidth overhead by sharing KV parameters (loading fewer\\nweights).\\n• Decoding strategy optimization aims to improve the se-\\nquential nature of the auto-regressive generation manner in\\ndifferent ways. As a representative study, speculative decod-\\ning [323, 324] first leverages a compact but efficient model\\n(e.g., a n-gram model or a small PLM) to generate short\\nsegments and then utilizes the LLM to verify and correct\\nthese drafts.

Researchers\\nfurther suggest several variants to improve the efficiency of\\nthis approach, such as a learning-based method to combine\\nseveral small models [325] and a stage-wise acceleration\\nwhich employs a more smaller LM to accelerate the small\\nLM first [326]. In addition, token-level early-exit techniques\\nhave been proposed enabling the generation of a token at\\nlower Transformer layers, rather than passing through all\\nthe layers [327]. It can attain greater speedup, but at the cost\\nof sacrificing generation quality.\\nPractical Settings. In practice, existing libraries ( e.g., Trans-\\nformers [187]) and public APIs of LLMs ( e.g., OpenAI) have\\nsupported various decoding strategies to serve different\\nscenarios of text generation. Next, we present the decoding\\nsettings of several representative LLMs:\\n• T5 [82] utilizes greedy search as the default setting and\\napplies beam search (beam size of 4) with a length penalty\\nof 0.6 for translation and summarization tasks.\\n• GPT-3 [55] employs beam search with a beam size of 4\\nand a length penalty of 0.6 for all generation tasks.\\n• Alpaca [142] utilizes sampling-based strategies with\\ntop-k (k = 50), top-p (p = 0.9), and temperature of 0.7 for\\nopen-ended generation.\\n• LLaMA [57] applies diverse decoding strategies tai-\\nlored to specific tasks. For instance, it employs the greedy\\nsearch for question answering tasks while utilizes a sam-\\npling strategy with the temperature settings of 0.1 (pass@1)\\nand 0.8 (pass@100) for code generation.\\n• OpenAI API supports several basic decoding strate-\\ngies, including greedy search (by setting temperature to\\n0), beam search (with the setting best_of), temperature\\nsampling (with the setting temperature), nucleus sam-\\npling (with the setting top_p). It also introduce param-\\neters presence_penalty and frequency_penalty to\\ncontrol the repetition degree of generation. According to\\nthe OpenAI’s document, their APIs would produce different\\noutputs even if the input and the hyper-parameters are the\\nsame. Setting temperature to 0 can yield more deterministic\\noutputs, albeit with a slight chance of variability.\\n4.2.6 Summary and Discussion\\nThe choice of architecture and pre-training tasks may incur\\ndifferent inductive biases for LLMs, which would lead to\\ndifferent model capacities. In this part, we discuss one open\\nissue about the architecture choice for LLMs.\\nWhy does Predicting the Next Word Works?\\nThe essence of decoder-only architecture is to\\naccurately predict the next word for reconstructing\\nthe pre-training data. Till now, there has been no\\nformal study that theoretically demonstrates its\\nadvantage over other architectures. An interesting\\nexplanation was from Ilya Sutskever during the\\ninterview held by Jensen Huang a. The original\\ntranscript from the interview was copied below b:\\nSay you read a detective novel.

In earlier literature of pre-trained lan-\\nguage models, there are lots of discussions on the effects\\nof different architectures [29, 89]. However, most LLMs are\\ndeveloped based on the causal decoder architecture, and\\nthere still lacks a theoretical analysis on its advantage over\\nthe other alternatives. Next, we briefly summarize existing\\ndiscussions on this issue.\\n• By pre-training with the LM objective, it seems that\\ncausal decoder architecture can achieve a superior zero-\\nshot and few-shot generalization capacity. Existing research\\nhas shown that without multi-task fine-tuning, the causal\\ndecoder has better zero-shot performance than other archi-\\ntectures [29]. The success of GPT-3 [55] has demonstrates\\nthat the large causal decoder model can be a good few-\\nshot learner. In addition, instruction tuning and alignment\\ntuning discussed in Section 5 have been proven to fur-\\nther enhance the capability of large causal decoder mod-\\nels [66, 67, 69].\\n• Scaling law has been widely observed in causal de-\\ncoders. By scaling the model size, the dataset size, and\\nthe total computation, the performance of causal decoders\\ncan be substantially improved [30, 55]. Thus, it has become\\nan important strategy to increase the model capacity of\\nthe causal decoder via scaling. However, more detailed\\ninvestigation on encoder-decoder models is still lacking, and\\nmore efforts are needed to investigate the performance of\\nencoder-decoder models at a large scale.\\nMore research efforts about the discussions on architec-'),\n",

Despite the effectiveness of decoder-only architec-\\nture, it is also suggested to make more diverse exploration\\non architecture design. Besides the major architecture, the\\ndetailed configuration of LLM is also worth attention, which\\nhas been discussed in Section 4.2.2.\\n4.3 Model Training\\nIn this part, we review the important settings, techniques,\\nor tricks for training LLMs.\\n4.3.1 Optimization Setting\\nFor parameter optimization of LLMs, we present the com-\\nmonly used settings for batch training, learning rate, opti-\\nmizer, and training stability.\\nBatch Training. For language model pre-training, existing\\nwork generally sets the batch size to a large number ( e.g.,\\n2,048 examples or 4M tokens) to improve the training\\nstability and throughput. For LLMs such as GPT-3 and\\nPaLM, they have introduced a new strategy that dynam-\\nically increases the batch size during training, ultimately\\nreaching a million scale. Specifically, the batch size of GPT-3\\nis gradually increasing from 32K to 3.2M tokens. Empirical\\nresults have demonstrated that the dynamic schedule of\\nbatch size can effectively stabilize the training process of\\nLLMs [56].\\nLearning Rate. Existing LLMs usually adopt a similar learn-\\ning rate schedule with the warm-up and decay strategies\\nduring pre-training. Specifically, in the initial 0.1% to 0.5%\\nof the training steps, a linear warm-up schedule is employed\\nfor gradually increasing the learning rate to the maximum\\nvalue that ranges from approximately 5 × 10−5 to 1 × 10−4\\n(e.g., 6 × 10−5 for GPT-3). Then, a cosine decay strategy\\nis adopted in the subsequent steps, gradually reducing the\\nlearning rate to approximately 10% of its maximum value,\\nuntil the convergence of the training loss.\\nOptimizer. The Adam optimizer [328] and AdamW opti-\\nmizer [329] are widely utilized for training LLMs (e.g., GPT-\\n3), which are based on adaptive estimates of lower-order\\nmoments for first-order gradient-based optimization. Com-\\nmonly, its hyper-parameters are set as follows: β1 = 0 .9,\\nβ2 = 0 .95 and ϵ = 10 −8. Meanwhile, the Adafactor op-\\ntimizer [330] has also been utilized in training LLMs ( e.g.,\\nPaLM and T5), which is a variant of the Adam optimizer\\nspecially designed for conserving GPU memory during\\ntraining. The hyper-parameters of the Adafactor optimizer\\nare set as: β1 = 0.9 and β2 = 1.0 − k−0.8, where k denotes\\nthe number of training steps.\\nStabilizing the Training. During the pre-training of LLMs,\\nit often suffers from the training instability issue, which\\nmay cause the model collapse. To address this issue, weight\\ndecay and gradient clipping have been widely utilized,\\nwhere existing studies [55, 78, 90, 93, 113] commonly set\\nthe threshold of gradient clipping to 1.0 and weight decay\\nrate to 0.1. However, with the scaling of LLMs, the training\\nloss spike is also more likely to occur, leading to unstable\\ntraining. To mitigate this problem, PaLM [56] and OPT [90]\\nuse a simple strategy that restarts the training process from\\nan earlier checkpoint before the occurrence of the spike and\\nskips over the data that may have caused the problem.\\nFurther, GLM [93] finds that the abnormal gradients of the\\nembedding layer usually lead to spikes, and proposes to\\nshrink the embedding layer gradients to alleviate it.\\n4.3.2 Scalable Training Techniques\\nAs the model and data sizes increase, it has become chal-\\nlenging to efficiently train LLMs under a limited compu-\\ntational resource. Especially, two primary technical issues\\nare required to be resolved, i.e., increasing training through-\\nput and loading larger models into GPU memory. In this\\npart, we review several widely used approaches in existing\\nwork to address the above two challenges, namely 3D\\nparallelism [75, 331, 332], ZeRO [333], and mixed precision\\ntraining [334], and also give general suggestions about how\\nto utilize them for training.\\n3D Parallelism. 3D parallelism is actually a combination of\\nthree commonly used parallel training techniques, namely\\ndata parallelism, pipeline parallelism [331, 332], and tensor\\nparallelism [75]24. We next introduce the three parallel train-\\ning techniques.\\n• Data parallelism. Data parallelism is one of the most\\nfundamental approaches to improving the training through-\\nput. It replicates the model parameters and optimizer states\\nacross multiple GPUs and then distributes the whole train-\\ning corpus into these GPUs. In this way, each GPU only\\nneeds to process the assigned data for it, and performs\\nthe forward and backward propagation to obtain the gra-\\ndients. The computed gradients on different GPUs will be\\nfurther aggregated to obtain the gradients of the entire batch\\nfor updating the models in all GPUs. In this way, as the\\ncalculations of gradients are independently performed on\\ndifferent GPUs, the data parallelism mechanism is highly\\nscalable, enabling the way that increases the number of\\nGPUs to improve training throughput. Furthermore, this\\ntechnique is simple in implementation, and most of existing\\npopular deep learning libraries have already implemented\\ndata parallelism, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.\\n• Pipeline parallelism. Pipeline parallelism aims to dis-\\ntribute the different layers of a LLM into multiple GPUs.\\nEspecially, in the case of a Transformer model, pipeline\\nparallelism loads consecutive layers onto the same GPU, to\\nreduce the cost of transmitting the computed hidden states\\nor gradients between GPUs. However, a naive implemen-\\ntation of pipeline parallelism may result in a lower GPU\\nutilization rate as each GPU has to wait for the previous\\none to complete the computation, leading to the unneces-\\nsary cost of bubbles overhead [331]. To reduce these bubbles\\nin pipeline parallelism, GPipe [331] and PipeDream [332]\\npropose the techniques of padding multiple batches of data\\nand asynchronous gradient update to improve the pipeline\\nefficiency.\\n• Tensor parallelism. Tensor parallelism is also a com-\\nmonly used technique that aims to decompose the LLM for\\n24. Model parallelism is a more broader term that includes tensor\\nparallelism and pipeline parallelism in some work [75].'),\n",

Unlike pipeline parallelism, tensor par-\\nallelism focuses on decomposing the tensors (the parameter\\nmatrices) of LLMs. For a matrix multiplication operation\\nY = XA in the LLM, the parameter matrix A can be\\nsplit into two submatrices, A1 and A2, by column, which\\ncan be expressed as Y = [XA1, XA2]. By placing matrices\\nA1 and A2 on different GPUs, the matrix multiplication\\noperation would be invoked at two GPUs in parallel, and\\nthe final result can be obtained by combining the outputs\\nfrom the two GPUs through across-GPU communication.\\nCurrently, tensor parallelism has been supported in several\\nopen-source libraries, e.g., Megatron-LM [75], and can be\\nextended to higher-dimensional tensors. Also, Colossal-AI\\nhas implemented tensor parallelism for higher-dimensional\\ntensors [335–337] and proposed sequence parallelism [338]\\nespecially for sequence data, which can further decompose\\nthe attention operation of the Transformer model.\\nZeRO. ZeRO [333] technique, proposed by the Deep-\\nSpeed [74] library, focuses on the issue of memory re-\\ndundancy in data parallelism. As mentioned before, data\\nparallelism requires each GPU to store the same copy of\\na LLM, including model parameters, model gradients, and\\noptimizer parameters. Whereas, not all of the above data is\\nnecessary to be retained on each GPU, which would cause\\na memory redundancy problem. To resolve it, the ZeRO\\ntechnique aims to retain only a fraction of data on each\\nGPU, while the rest data can be retrieved from other GPUs\\nwhen required. Specifically, ZeRO provides three solutions,\\ndepending on how the three parts of the data are stored,\\nnamely optimizer state partitioning, gradient partitioning,\\nand parameter partitioning. Empirical results indicate that\\nthe first two solutions do not increase the communication\\noverhead, and the third solution increases about 50% com-\\nmunication overhead but saves memory proportional to\\nthe number of GPUs. PyTorch has implemented a similar\\ntechnique as ZeRO, called FSDP [339].\\nMixed Precision Training. In previous PLMs ( e.g.,\\nBERT [23]), 32-bit floating-point numbers, also known as\\nFP32, have been predominantly used for pre-training. In\\nrecent years, to pre-train extremely large language models,\\nsome studies [334] have started to utilize 16-bit floating-\\npoint numbers (FP16), which reduces memory usage and\\ncommunication overhead. Additionally, as popular NVIDIA\\nGPUs (e.g., A100) have twice the amount of FP16 computa-\\ntion units as FP32, the computational efficiency of FP16 can\\nbe further improved. However, existing work has found that\\nFP16 may lead to the loss of computational accuracy [64, 78],\\nwhich affects the final model performance. To alleviate it, an\\nalternative called Brain Floating Point (BF16) has been used\\nfor training, which allocates more exponent bits and fewer\\nsignificant bits than FP16. For pre-training, BF16 generally\\nperforms better than FP16 on representation accuracy [78].\\nOverall Training Suggestion. In practice, the above train-\\ning techniques, especially 3D parallelism, are often jointly\\nused to improve the training throughput and large model\\nloading. For instance, researchers have incorporated 8-way\\ndata parallelism, 4-way tensor parallelism, and 12-way\\npipeline parallelism, enabling the training of BLOOM [78]\\non 384 A100 GPUs. Currently, open-source libraries like\\nDeepSpeed [74], Colossal-AI [189], and Alpa [340] can well\\nsupport the three parallel training methods. To reduce the\\nmemory redundancy, ZeRO, FSDP , and activation recom-\\nputation techniques [77, 341] can be also employed for\\ntraining LLMs, which have already been integrated into\\nDeepSpeed, PyTorch, and Megatron-LM. In addition, the\\nmixed precision training technique such as BF16 can be\\nalso leveraged to improve the training efficiency and reduce\\nGPU memory usage, while it requires necessary support on\\nhardware (e.g., A100 GPU). Because training large models is\\na time-intensive process, it would be useful to forecast the\\nmodel performance and detect abnormal issues at an early\\nstage. For this purpose, GPT-4 [46] has recently introduced\\na new mechanism called predictable scaling built on a deep\\nlearning stack, enabling the performance prediction of large\\nmodels with a much smaller model, which might be quite\\nuseful for developing LLMs. In practice, one can further\\nleverage the supporting training techniques of mainstream\\ndeep learning frameworks. For instance, PyTorch supports\\nthe data parallel training algorithm FSDP [339] ( i.e., fully\\nsharded data parallel), which allows for partial offloading'),\n",

However, an increasing number\\nof studies have shown that LLM’s abilities can be further\\nadapted according to specific goals. In this section, we\\nintroduce two major approaches to adapting pre-trained\\nLLMs, namely instruction tuning and alignment tuning. The\\nformer approach mainly aims to enhance (or unlock) the\\nabilities of LLMs, while the latter approach aims to align the\\nbehaviors of LLMs with human values or preferences. Fur-\\nther, we will also discuss efficient tuning and quantization\\nfor model adaptation in resource-limited settings. In what\\nfollows, we will introduce the four parts in detail.\\n5.1 Instruction Tuning\\nIn essence, instruction tuning is the approach to fine-tuning\\npre-trained LLMs on a collection of formatted instances in\\nthe form of natural language [67], which is highly related\\nto supervised fine-tuning [66] and multi-task prompted\\ntraining [28]. In order to perform instruction tuning, we first\\nneed to collect or construct instruction-formatted instances.\\nThen, we employ these formatted instances to fine-tune\\nLLMs in a supervised learning way ( e.g., training with the\\nsequence-to-sequence loss). After instruction tuning, LLMs\\ncan demonstrate superior abilities to generalize to unseen\\ntasks [28, 67, 69], even in a multilingual setting [94].\\nA recent survey [342] presents a systematic overview\\nof the research on instruction tuning. In comparison to\\nthat, we mainly focus on the effect of instruction tuning\\non LLMs and provide detailed guidelines or strategies for\\ninstance collection and tuning. In addition, we also discuss\\nthe use of instruction tuning for satisfying the real needs of\\nusers, which has been widely applied in existing LLMs, e.g.,\\nInstructGPT [66] and GPT-4 [46].\\n5.1.1 Formatted Instance Construction\\nGenerally, an instruction-formatted instance consists of a\\ntask description (called an instruction), an optional input,\\nthe corresponding output, and a small number of demon-\\nstrations (optional). As important public resources, existing\\nstudies have released a large number of labeled data format-\\nted in natural language (see the list of available resources in\\nTable 3) as introduced in Section 3.3.1. Next, we introduce\\nthree major methods for constructing formatted instances\\n(see an illustration in Figure 11) and then discuss several\\nkey factors for instance construction.\\nFormatting NLP Task Datasets. Before instruction tuning\\nwas proposed, several early studies [168, 343, 344] collected\\nthe instances from a diverse range of traditional NLP tasks\\n(e.g., text summarization, text classification, and translation)\\nto create supervised multi-task training datasets. As a major\\nsource of instruction tuning instances, it is convenient to for-\\nmat these multi-task training datasets with natural language\\ntask descriptions. Specifically, recent work [28, 66, 67, 88]\\naugments the labeled datasets with human-written task de-\\nscriptions, which instructs LLMs to understand the tasks by\\nexplaining the task goal. For example, in Figure 11(a), a task\\ndescription “ Please answer this question ” is added for each\\nexample in the question-answering task. After instruction\\ntuning, LLMs can generalize well to other unseen tasks by\\nfollowing their task descriptions [28, 67, 69]. In particular,\\nit has been shown that instructions are the crucial factor\\nin task generalization ability for LLMs [67]: by fine-tuning\\nthe model on labeled datasets with the task descriptions re-\\nmoved, it results in a dramatic drop in model performance.\\nTo better generate labeled instances for instruction tuning,\\na crowd-sourcing platform, PromptSource [167] has been\\nproposed to effectively create, share, and verify the task\\ndescriptions for different datasets. To enrich the training\\ninstances, several studies [28, 168, 345] also try to invert the\\ninput-output pairs of existing instances with specially de-\\nsigned task descriptions for instruction tuning. For instance,\\ngiven a question-answer pair, we can create a new instance\\nby predicting the answer-conditioned question ( e.g., “Please\\ngenerate a question based on the answer:” ).\\nFormatting Daily Chat Data. Despite that a large number\\nof training instances have been formatted with instructions,\\nthey mainly come from public NLP datasets, either lack-\\ning instruction diversity or mismatching with real human\\nneeds [66]. To overcome this issue, InstructGPT [66] pro-\\nposes to take the queries that real users have submitted to\\nthe OpenAI API as the task descriptions. Additionally, to\\nenrich the task diversity, human labelers are also asked to\\ncompose the instructions for real-life tasks, including open-\\nended generation, open question answering, brainstorm-\\ning, and chatting. Then, they let another group of labelers\\ndirectly answer these instructions as the output. Finally,\\nthey pair one instruction ( i.e., the collected user query) and\\nthe expected output ( i.e., the human-written answer) as a\\ntraining instance. Note that InstructGPT also employs these\\nreal-world tasks formatted in natural language for align-\\nment tuning (discussed in Section 5.2). Further, GPT-4 [46]\\nhas designed potentially high-risk instructions and guided\\nthe model to reject these instructions through supervised\\nfine-tuning for safety concerns. Considering the absence\\nof high-quality public chat data, several studies have also\\ncollected users’ chat requests as input data, and then utilized\\nChatGPT or GPT-4 to generate responses as output data. A\\nnotable example of such a dataset is the conversational data\\nfrom ShareGPT [148]. Additionally, Dolly [172] and Ope-\\nnAssistant [173] have further released their conversation\\ndata, which has been carefully labeled by human annotators\\nto attain a high level of quality.\\nFormatting Synthetic Data. To reduce the burden of human\\nannotation or manual collection, several semi-automated\\napproaches [143] have been proposed for constructing in-\\nstances by feeding existing instances into LLMs to synthe-\\nsize diverse task descriptions and instances. As illustrated\\nin Figure 11(c), the Self-Instruct method only needs 175\\ninstances as the initial task pool. Then, they randomly select\\na few instances from the pool as demonstrations and prompt\\na LLM to generate new instructions and corresponding\\ninput-output pairs. After the quality and diversity filter-\\ning, newly generated instances would be added into the\\ntask pool. Hence, the synthetic method is an effective and\\neconomical way to generate large-scale instruction data for'),\n",

To improve\\nthe quality of synthetic int ructions, WizardLM [346] intro-\\nduces Evol-Instruct by proposing in-depth and in-breadth\\nevolving to enrich the complexity and diversity of the\\ninstances. Furthermore, Self-Align [347] establishes multiple\\nhuman-aligned principles to filter the synthesized instances.\\nIt then employs these instances to train a LLM in order\\nto yield more aligned instances. To enhance the quality\\nof the instance output, researchers directly adopt human-\\nwritten texts as the output and synthesize corresponding\\ninstructions using ICL examples [348].\\nKey Factors for Instance Construction. The quality of\\ninstruction instances has an important impact on the perfor-\\nmance of the model. Here, we discuss some essential factors\\nfor instance construction.\\n• Scaling the instructions. It has been widely shown that\\nscaling the number of tasks can largely enhance the gen-\\neralization ability of LLMs [28, 67, 88]. With the increasing\\nof the task number, the model performance initially shows\\na continuous growth pattern, while the gain becomes neg-\\nligible when it reaches a certain level [69, 88]. A plausible\\nspeculation is that a certain number of representative tasks\\ncan provide relatively sufficient knowledge and adding\\nmore tasks may not bring additional gains [69]. Also, it is\\nbeneficial to enhance the diversity of the task descriptions in\\nseveral aspects, such as length, structure, and creativity [28].\\nAs for the number of instances per task, it has been found\\nthat a small number of instances can usually saturate the\\ngeneralization performance of the model to perform a spe-\\ncific task [67, 69]. Specially, several recent work [349, 350]\\nhas explored the effect of fine-tuning with a small amount of\\nhigh-quality instruction data (e.g., one or a few thousand in-\\nstances), showing very promising results on the evaluation\\ntasks. In contrast, another line of studies continue to explore\\nthe scaling effect of instruction data [351, 352]. For example,\\nOrca [351] scales up the synthesized instances to 5 million\\nwith step-by-step explanations, and it achieves superior\\nperformance across a wide range of tasks compared to the\\nmethods tuned with instruction data.\\n• Formatting design. As an important factor, the design\\nof natural language format also highly impacts the gener-\\nalization performance of LLMs [88]. Typically, we can add\\ntask descriptions and optional demonstrations to the input-\\noutput pairs of existing datasets, where the task description\\nis the most key part for LLMs to understand the task [88].\\nFurther, it can lead to substantial improvements by using an\\nappropriate number of exemplars as demonstrations [69],\\nwhich also alleviates the model sensitivity to instruction\\nengineering [67, 69]. However, incorporating other compo-\\nnents ( e.g., things to avoid, reasons, and suggestions) into\\ninstructions may have a negligible or even adverse effect\\non the performance of LLMs [88, 166]. Recently, to elicit\\nthe step-by-step reasoning ability of LLMs, some work [69]\\nproposes to include chain-of-thought (CoT) examples for\\nsome reasoning datasets, such as arithmetic reasoning. It\\nhas been shown that fine-tuning LLMs with both CoT and\\nnon-CoT examples can lead to a good performance across\\nvarious reasoning tasks, including those that require multi-\\nhop reasoning ability ( e.g., commonsense question answer-\\ning and arithmetic reasoning) as well as those without the\\nneed for such a reasoning way ( e.g., sentiment analysis and\\nextractive question answering) [69, 95].\\nTo summarize, diversity and quality of instructions seem\\nto be more important than the number of instances [349]\\nsince the well-performing InstructGPT [66] and LLaMA-2-\\nChat [99] utilize fewer but more diverse instructions (or\\ninstances) than the Flan-series LLMs [67, 69]. However,\\na large amount of training data may compensate for the\\nabsence of high-quality data [351]. Further, it is more useful\\nto invite labelers to compose human-need tasks than using\\ndataset-specific tasks. However, it still lacks general guide-\\nlines to annotate human-need instances, making the task\\ncomposition somehow heuristic. To reduce human efforts,\\nwe can either reuse existing formatted datasets (Table 3)\\nor automatically construct the instructions using existing\\nLLMs [143]. We conduct a preliminary experiment to show'),\n",

Since instruction tuning can be considered as\\na supervised training process, its optimization is different\\nfrom pre-training in several aspects [69], such as the training\\nobjective (i.e., sequence-to-sequence loss) and optimization\\nconfiguration ( e.g., smaller batch size and learning rate),\\nwhich require special attention in practice. In addition to\\nthese optimization configurations, there are also four im-\\nportant aspects to consider for instruction tuning:\\nBalancing the Data Distribution. Since instruction tun-\\ning involves a mixture of different tasks, it is important\\nto balance the proportion of different tasks during fine-\\ntuning. A widely used method is the examples-proportional\\nmixing strategy [82], i.e., combining all the datasets and\\nsampling each instance equally from the mixed datasets.\\nFurthermore, increasing the sampling ratio of high-quality\\ncollections ( e.g., FLAN [67] and P3 [167]) can generally\\nlead to performance improvement according to recent find-\\nings [69, 95]. Further, it is common to set a maximum\\ncap to control the maximum number of examples that a\\ndataset can contain during instruction tuning [82], which\\nis set to prevent larger datasets from overwhelming the\\nentire distribution [82, 95]. In practice, the maximum cap\\nis typically set to several thousands or tens of thousands\\naccording to different datasets [67, 69]. Recently, it has been\\nempirically found that existing instruction datasets (Table 3)\\nmainly focus on enhancing LLMs’ capabilities in certain\\naspects, and a single dataset alone cannot lead to a compre-\\nhensive enhancement in model capacity [353]. Therefore, it\\nis often suggested to use a mixture of existing instruction\\ndatasets to achieve a balanced improvement in different\\ncapacities, including NLP task data ( e.g., FLAN v2 [292]),\\nchat data ( e.g., ShareGPT [148]), and synthetic data ( e.g.,\\nGPT4-Alpaca [354]).\\nCombining Instruction T uning and Pre-Training.To make\\nthe tuning process more effective and stable, OPT-IML [95]\\nincorporates pre-training data during instruction tuning,\\nwhich can be regarded as regularization for model tuning.\\nFurther, instead of using a separate two-stage process ( pre-\\ntraining then instruction tuning ), some studies attempt to\\ntrain a model from scratch with a mixture of pre-training\\ndata ( i.e., plain texts) and instruction tuning data ( i.e., for-\\nmatted datasets) using multi-task learning [82]. Specifically,\\nGLM-130B [93] and Galactica [35] integrate instruction-\\nformatted datasets as a small proportion of the pre-training\\ncorpora to pre-train LLMs, which potentially achieves the\\nadvantages of pre-training and instruction tuning at the\\nsame time.\\nMulti-stage Instruction T uning. For instruction tuning,\\nthere are two kinds of important instruction data, namely\\ntask-formatted instructions and daily chat instructions. Gen-\\nerally, the former has a significantly larger volume than the\\nlatter. It is important to balance the training with the two\\nkinds of instruction data. In addition to carefully mixing\\ndifferent instruction data, we can also adopt a multi-stage\\ninstruction tuning strategy [352], where LLMs are first fine-\\ntuned with large-scale task-formatted instructions and sub-\\nsequently fine-tuned on daily chat ones. To avoid the capac-\\nity forgetting issue, it is also useful to add an amount of task-\\nformatted instructions at the second stage. Actually, such\\na multi-stage tuning strategy can be also applied to other\\nsettings for instruction tuning. For example, we can sched-\\nule different fine-tuning stages with progressively increased\\nlevels on difficulty and complexity, and gradually improve\\nthe capacities of LLMs to follow complex instructions.\\nOther Practical Tricks. In practice, there are also several\\nuseful strategies and tricks that are helpful to improve the\\nfine-tuning performance of LLMs. We list several represen-\\ntative ones as follows:\\n• Efficient training for multi-turn chat data. Given a multi-\\nturn chat example (the conversation between a user and\\nchatbot), a straightforward fine-tuning way is to split it into\\nmultiple context-response pairs for training: a LLM is fine-\\ntuned to generate the response based on the correspond-\\ning context for all splits ( i.e., at each utterance from the\\nuser). In such a fine-tuning way, it is apparent that there\\nexist overlapping utterances in the split examples from a\\nconversation. To save the training cost, Vicuna [138] has\\nadopted an efficient way that feeds the whole conversation\\ninto the LLM, but relies on a loss mask that only computes\\nthe loss on the responses of the chatbot for training. It can\\nsignificantly reduce the compute costs derived from the\\noverlapped utterances.\\n• Establishing self-identification for LLM. To deploy LLMs\\nfor real-world applications, it is necessary to establish its\\nidentity and make LLMs aware of these identity informa-\\ntion, such as name, developer and affiliation. A practical\\nway is to create identity-related instructions for fine-tuning\\nthe LLM. It is also feasible to prefix the input with the self-\\nidentification prompt, e.g., “The following is a conversation\\nbetween a human and an AI assistant called CHATBOT NAME ,\\ndeveloped by DEVELOPER .”, where C HATBOT NAME and D E-\\nVELOPER refer to the name and developer of the chatbot,\\nrespectively.\\nIn addition to the above practical strategies and tricks,\\nexisting work has also used other tricks, e.g., concatenating\\nmultiple examples into a single sequence to approach the\\nmax length [355].\\n5.1.3 The Effect of Instruction Tuning\\nIn this part, we discuss the effect of instruction tuning on\\nLLMs in three major aspects.\\nPerformance Improvement. Despite being tuned on a mod-\\nerate number of instances, instruction tuning has become\\nan important way to improve or unlock the abilities of\\nLLMs [69]. Recent studies have experimented with language\\nmodels in multiple scales (ranging from 77M to 540B),\\nshowing that the models of different scales can all benefit\\nfrom instruction tuning [69, 345], yielding improved perfor-\\nmance as the parameter scale increases [94]. Further, smaller\\nmodels with instruction tuning can even perform better\\nthan larger models without fine-tuning [28, 69]. Besides\\nthe model scale, instruction tuning demonstrates consistent\\nimprovements in various model architectures, pre-training'),\n",

The major\\ndifference between A800 and A100 lies in the NVLink interconnect speed. Thus, our estimations about training and\\ninference efficiency would be slightly improved for A100, while the rest memory consumption would remain the same.\\nFor full tuning experiments, we use data parallel training, ZeRO Stage 3, BF16, and gradient checkpointing. Additionally,\\nthe LoRA tuning can be executed on one 80G GPU utilizing INT8 quantization with the rank setting set to 16. All the\\nexperiments are conducted with Alpaca-52K dataset by training LLaMA models three epochs. The max sequence length\\nfor both training settings is set to 512.

In practice,\\ninstruction tuning offers a general approach to enhancing\\nthe abilities of existing language models [69] (including\\nsmall-sized PLMs). Also, it is much less costly than pre-\\ntraining, since the amount of instruction data required by\\nLLMs is significantly smaller than pre-training data.\\nTask Generalization. Instruction tuning encourages the\\nmodel to understand natural language instructions for task\\ncompletion. It endows LLMs with the ability (often con-\\nsidered as an emergent ability) to follow human instruc-\\ntions [31] to perform specific tasks without demonstrations,\\neven on unseen tasks [69]. A large number of studies\\nhave confirmed the effectiveness of instruction tuning to\\nachieve superior performance on both seen and unseen\\ntasks [95, 345]. Also, instruction tuning has been shown to\\nbe useful in alleviating several weaknesses of LLMs ( e.g.,\\nrepetitive generation or complementing the input without\\naccomplishing a certain task) [66, 69], leading to a superior\\ncapacity to solve real-world tasks for LLMs. Furthermore,\\nLLMs trained with instruction tuning can generalize to re-\\nlated tasks across languages. For example, BLOOMZ-P3 [94]\\nis fine-tuned based on BLOOM [78] using English-only task\\ncollection P3 [167]. Interestingly, BLOOMZ-P3 can achieve\\na more than 50% improvement in multilingual sentence\\ncompletion tasks compared to BLOOM, which shows that\\ninstruction tuning can help LLMs acquire general task skills\\nfrom English-only datasets and transfer such skills into\\nother languages [94]. In addition, it has been found that\\nusing English-only instructions can produce satisfactory\\nresults on multilingual tasks [94], which helps reduce the\\neffort of instruction engineering for a specific language.\\nDomain Specialization. Existing LLMs have showcased su-\\nperior capabilities in traditional NLP tasks ( e.g., generation\\nand reasoning) and daily questions. However, they may\\nstill lack domain knowledge to accomplish specific tasks,\\nsuch as medicine, law, and finance (See Section 8 for a\\ndetailed discussion of LLMs in different applications). In-\\nstruction tuning is an effective approach to adapting existing\\ngeneral LLMs to be domain-specific experts. For instance,\\nresearchers propose to fine-tune Flan-PaLM [69] using medi-\\ncal datasets to create Med-PaLM [356], a medical knowledge\\nassistant that achieves performance levels comparable to\\nthose of expert clinicians. Furthermore, a recent study [357]\\nfine-tunes FLAN-T5 to support e-commerce recommender\\nsystems with natural language instructions, showing strong\\nperformance in a variety of recommendation tasks. There\\nare also several open-sourced medical models instruction-\\ntuned based on LLaMA [57], such as BenTsao [358]. Also,\\nresearchers explore instruction tuning on law [359], fi-\\nnance [360], and arithmetic computation [361].\\n5.1.4 Empirical Analysis for Instruction Tuning\\nFine-tuning LLMs with different instruction sets tend to lead\\nto model variants with varied performance on downstream\\ntasks. In this section, we will explore the effect of different\\ntypes of instructions in fine-tuning LLMs ( i.e., LLaMA (7B)\\nand LLaMA (13B) 25), as well as examine the usefulness of\\nseveral instruction improvement strategies.\\nInstruction Datasets. According to the discussion in Sec-\\ntion 5.1.1, we mainly consider three common kinds of in-\\nstructions as follows:\\n• Task-specific instructions. For the first type of instruc-\\ntions, we adopt the most commonly-used multi-task instruc-\\ntion dataset, FLAN-T5 [69], which contains 1,836 tasks and\\nover 15M instructions by combining four data mixtures from\\nprior work.\\n• Daily chat instructions. This type of instructions are con-\\nversations posed by users about daily life, which are more\\nclosely related to real-life scenarios. We adopt the ShareGPT\\ninstruciton set, consisting of 63K real-user instructions. It\\nhas been used as the core instructions for Vicuna.\\n• Synthetic instructions. In addition to reusing existing\\ninstructions, we can also automatically synthesize massive\\ninstructions using LLMs. We adopt the popular synthetic\\ninstruction dataset Self-Instruct-52K [143], consisting of 52K\\ninstructions paired with about 82K instance inputs and\\noutputs. These generated instructions have a similar data\\ndistribution as the human-written seed tasks ( e.g., grammar\\nchecking, brainstorming).\\nAs the original FLAN-T5 dataset is very large ( i.e., over\\n15M), we randomly sample 80,000 instructions from it for\\nconducting a fair comparison with other instruction datasets\\n25. Due to the limit of computational resources, we cannot conduct\\nlarge-scale experiments on larger LLaMA variants right now, which\\nwould be scheduled in a future version.'),\n",

Although real-world instructions\\nfrom human users are more suitable for fine-tuning LLMs,\\nit is difficult to collect them at a large scale. As alternatives\\nto human-generated instructions, most existing research\\nmainly adopts synthetic instructions generated by LLMs.\\nHowever, there are some potential problems with synthetic\\ninstructions, such as poor topic diversity and uneven in-\\nstruction difficulty (either too simple or too difficult). Thus,\\nit is necessary to improve the quality of the synthetic in-\\nstructions. Next, we summarize four major improvement\\nstrategies widely used in existing work as follows:\\n• Enhancing the instruction complexity. As discussed in\\nexisting work [346], enhancing the complexity of instruc-\\ntions can improve the model capacity of LLMs in following\\ncomplex instructions, e.g., including more task demands or\\nrequiring more reasoning steps. To validate this strategy,\\nwe follow WizardLM [346] by gradually increasing the\\ncomplexity levels, e.g., adding constraints, increasing rea-\\nsoning steps, and complicating the input. We leverage the\\npublicly released WizardLM-70K instructions [346] as the\\ncomplexity-enhanced instruction dataset, which has been\\ngenerated via the above enhancement approach based on\\nthe Self-Instruct-52K dataset [346].\\n• Increasing the topic diversity. In addition to the complex-\\nity, improving the topic diversity of the instruction dataset\\ncan help elicit different abilities of LLMs on diverse tasks in\\nreal world [347]. However, it is difficult to directly control\\nthe self-instruct process for generating diverse instructions.\\nFollowing YuLan-Chat [352], we employ ChatGPT to rewrite\\nthe instructions from Self-Instruct-52K dataset for adapting\\nthem into 293 topics via specific prompts. Finally, we obtain\\n70K instructions as the diversity-increased dataset.\\n• Scaling the instruction number. In addition to the above\\naspects, the number of instructions is also an important\\nfactor that may affect the model performance. Specially,\\nusing more instructions can extend the task knowledge and\\nimprove the ability of instruction following for LLMs [69].\\nTo examine this strategy, we sample new instructions from\\nthe synthesized instruction set released from the MOSS\\nproject [362], as they are also synthesized using the same\\nself-instruct method [143]. We mix them with the Self-\\nInstruct-52K dataset to compose a larger one containing\\n220K instructions.\\n• Balancing the instruction difficulty. As the synthetic\\ninstructions tend to contain too easy or too hard ones, it\\nis likely to result in training instability or even overfitting\\nfor LLMs. To explore the potential effects, we leverage\\nthe perplexity score of LLMs to estimate the difficulty of\\ninstructions and remove too easy or too hard instructions. To\\ngenerate the same scale of instructions for fair comparison,\\nwe adopt a LLaMA (7B) model to compute the perplexity for\\nthe 220K instructions from the large instruction dataset, and\\nthen keep 70K instructions of moderate perplexity scores as\\nthe difficulty-balanced dataset.\\nExperimental Setup. To conduct the experiments on the\\neffect of instruction data, we leverage these new instruction\\ndatasets for tuning LLaMA, a popular LLM backbone that\\nhas been widely used for instruction-tuning. We use the\\ncode from YuLan-Chat [352] for our experiments, and train\\nLLaMA 7B and 13B on a server of 8 A800-80G GPUs. All'),\n",

The chat setting mainly utilizes\\nuser instructions and queries from daily chat, whereas the\\nQA setting mainly employs question answering examples\\nfrom existing NLP datasets. The evaluation on the chat\\nsetting is conducted based on the AlpacaFarm evaluation\\nset [363].

The AI assistant gives\\nhelpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user’s questions. \\\\n\\n[|Human|]:{input}\\\\n[|AI|]:”. To reproduce our results, we\\nrelease the code and data at the link: https://github.com/\\nRUCAIBox/LLMSurvey/tree/main/Experiments.\\nResults and Analysis. The results using different instruction\\ndatasets based on 7B and 13B LLaMA are in Table 9. Next,\\nwe summarize and analyze our findings in detail.\\n• Task-formatted instructions are more proper for the QA\\nsetting, but may not be useful for the chat setting. By comparing\\nthe performance of instruction tuning using FLAN-T5 with\\nthat of ShareGPT and Self-Instruct-52K, we can observe\\nthat FLAN-T5 mostly achieves a better performance on QA\\nbenchmarks while underperforms ShareGPT on the chat set-\\nting. The reason is that FLAN-T5 is composed of a mixture\\nof instructions and examples from existing NLP tasks, e.g.,\\ntranslation and reading comprehension. As a result, LLaMA\\nfine-tuned with FLAN-T5 performs better on QA tasks, but\\npoorly on user queries. In contrast, ShareGPT consists of\\nreal-world human-ChatGPT conversations, which is able to\\nbetter elicit LLaMA to follow user instructions in daily life,\\nwhile may not be suitable for accomplishing the QA tasks.\\n• A mixture of different kinds of instructions are helpful to\\nimprove the comprehensive abilities of LLMs. After mixing the\\nthree kinds of instructions for fine-tuning, we can see that\\nthe derived LLaMA variant (with FLAN-T5, ShareGPT and\\nSelf-Instruct-52K) performs well in both task settings. In\\nMMLU, the performance of LLaMA (7B) can surpass the\\nones using individual instruction set by a large margin, i.e.,\\n43.69 vs. 38.58 (FLAN-T5). It shows that mixing multiple\\nsources of instruction datasets is helpful to improve the\\nperformance of instruction-tuned LLMs, which scales the\\ninstruction number as well as increases the diversity.\\n• Enhancing the complexity and diversity of instructions\\nleads to an improved model performance. By increasing the\\ncomplexity and diversity of the Self-Instruct-52K dataset\\nrespectively, the chat and QA performance of LLaMA can\\nbe consistently improved, e.g., from 37.52 to 39.73 in MMLU\\nfor LLaMA (7B). It demonstrates that both strategies are\\nuseful to improve the instruction following ability of LLMs.\\nFurther, we can see that improving the complexity yields a\\nlarger performance improvement on QA tasks. The reason\\nis that the QA tasks mostly consist of difficult questions for\\nevaluating LLMs, which can be better solved by LLMs that\\nhave learned complex instructions at the fine-tuning stage.\\n• Simply increasing the number of instructions may not be\\nthat useful, and balancing the difficulty is not always helpful.\\nAs the results shown in Table 9, balancing the difficulty\\nand increasing the number of fine-tuning instructions are\\nnot very helpful in our experiments. Especially for scaling\\nthe instruction number, it even hurts the performance, e.g.,\\na decrease from 29.81 to 26.63 in BBH for LLaMA (7B).\\nIt shows that simply scaling the number of synthesized\\ninstructions without quality control may not be effective to\\nimprove the performance. Furthermore, fine-tuning with the\\ninstructions of moderate difficulty also performs well in the\\nchat setting, while slightly decreasing the performance in\\nthe QA setting. A possible reason is that we filter complex\\nand hard instructions with large perplexity scores, hurting\\nthe model performance in answering complex questions.\\n• A larger model scale leads to a better instruction following\\nperformance. By comparing the performance of LLaMA (7B)\\nand LLaMA (13B) models fine-tuned with the same set\\nof instruction data, we can see that LLaMA (13B) mostly\\nachieves a better performance. It indicates that scaling the\\nmodel size is helpful for improving the instruction following\\ncapability. Besides, we can see that the QA performance has\\nbeen improved a lot, e.g., from 38.11 to 47.49 in MMLU. It is\\nlikely because that the larger models generally have better\\nknowledge utilization and reasoning capability [33, 55],\\nwhich can accurately answer more complex questions.\\nInstruction Tuning Suggestions\\nTo conduct instruction tuning on LLMs, one can\\nprepare the computational resources according to\\nthe basic statistics about the required number of\\nGPUs and tuning time in Table 8. After setting\\nup the development environment, we recommend\\nbeginners to follow the code of Alpaca reposi-\\ntory [137] for instruction tuning. Subsequently, one\\nshould select the base model and construct the\\ninstruction datasets as we discuss in this section.\\nWhen computational resources for training are con-\\nstrained, users can utilize LoRA for parameter-\\nefficient tuning (see Section 5.3). As for inference,\\nusers can further use quantization methods to de-\\nploy LLMs on fewer or smaller GPUs (see Sec-\\ntion 5.4).\\n5.2 Alignment Tuning\\nThis part first presents the background of alignment with\\nits definition and criteria, then focuses on the collection\\nof human feedback data for aligning LLMs, and finally'),\n",

LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities\\nin a wide range of NLP tasks [55, 56, 67, 90]. However,\\nthese models may sometimes exhibit unintended behav-\\niors, e.g., fabricating false information, pursuing inaccurate\\nobjectives, and producing harmful, misleading, and biased\\nexpressions [66, 366]. For LLMs, the language modeling\\nobjective pre-trains the model parameters by word predic-\\ntion while lacking the consideration of human values or\\npreferences. To avert these unexpected behaviors, human\\nalignment has been proposed to make LLMs act in line with\\nhuman expectations [66, 367]. However, unlike the original\\npre-training and adaptation tuning (e.g., instruction tuning),\\nsuch an alignment requires considering very different crite-\\nria (e.g., helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness). It has been\\nshown that alignment might harm the general abilities of\\nLLMs to some extent, which is called alignment tax in related\\nliterature [368].\\nAlignment Criteria. Recently, there is increasing attention\\non developing multifarious criteria to regulate the behav-\\niors of LLMs. Here, we take three representative alignment\\ncriteria (i.e., helpful, honest, and harmless) as examples for\\ndiscussion, which have been widely adopted in existing\\nliterature [66, 368]. In addition, there are other alignment\\ncriteria for LLMs from different perspectives including be-\\nhavior, intent, incentive, and inner aspects [366], which\\nare essentially similar (or at least with similar alignment\\ntechniques) to the above three criteria. It is also feasible to\\nmodify the three criteria according to specific needs, e.g.,\\nsubstituting honesty with correctness [116]. Next, we give\\nbrief explanations about the three representative alignment\\ncriteria:\\n• Helpfulness. To be helpful, the LLM should demon-\\nstrate a clear attempt to assist users in solving their tasks\\nor answering questions in a concise and efficient manner\\nas possible. At a higher level, when further clarification\\nis needed, the LLM should demonstrate the capability of\\neliciting additional relevant information through pertinent\\ninquiries and exhibit suitable levels of sensitivity, percep-\\ntiveness, and prudence [368]. Realizing the alignment of\\nhelpful behavior is challenging for LLMs since it is difficult\\nto precisely define and measure the intention of users [366].\\n• Honesty. At a basic level, a LLM aligned to be honest\\nshould present accurate content to users instead of fabri-\\ncating information. Additionally, it is crucial for the LLM\\nto convey appropriate degrees of uncertainty in its output,\\nin order to avoid any form of deception or misrepresen-\\ntation of information. This requires the model to know\\nabout its capabilities and levels of knowledge ( e.g., “know\\nunknowns”). According to the discussion in [368], honesty\\nis a more objective criterion compared to helpfulness and\\nharmlessness, hence honesty alignment could potentially be\\ndeveloped with less reliance on human efforts.\\n• Harmlessness. To be harmless, it requires that the lan-\\nguage produced by the model should not be offensive or\\ndiscriminatory. To the best of its abilities, the model should\\nbe capable of detecting covert endeavors aimed at soliciting\\nrequests for malicious purposes. Ideally, when the model\\nwas induced to conduct a dangerous action ( e.g., commit-\\nting a crime), the LLM should politely refuse. Nonetheless,\\nwhat behaviors are deemed harmful and to what extent vary\\namongst individuals or societies [368] highly depend on\\nwho is using the LLM, the type of the posed question, and\\nthe context (e.g., time) at which the LLM is being used.\\nAs we can see, these criteria are quite subjective, and are\\ndeveloped based on human cognition. Thus, it is difficult\\nto directly formulate them as optimization objectives for\\nLLMs. In existing work, there are many ways to fulfill these\\ncriteria when aligning LLMs. A promising technique is red\\nteaming [369], which involves using manual or automated\\nmeans to probe LLMs in an adversarial way to generate\\nharmful outputs and then updates LLMs to prevent such\\noutputs.\\n5.2.2 Collecting Human Feedback\\nDuring the pre-training stage, LLMs are trained using the\\nlanguage modeling objective on a large-scale corpus. How-\\never, it cannot take into account the subjective and qualita-\\ntive evaluations of LLM outputs by humans (called human\\nfeedback in this survey). High-quality human feedback is\\nextremely important for aligning LLMs with human pref-\\nerences and values. In this part, we discuss how to select a\\nteam of human labelers for feedback data collection.\\nHuman Labeler Selection. In existing work, the dominant\\nmethod for generating human feedback data is human\\nannotation [66, 116, 367]. This highlights the critical role\\nof selecting appropriate human labelers. To provide high-\\nquality feedback, human labelers are supposed to have a\\nqualified level of education and excellent proficiency in En-\\nglish. For example, Sparrow [116] requires human labelers\\nto be UK-based native English speakers who have obtained\\nat least an undergraduate-level educational qualification.\\nEven then, several studies [367] have found that there still\\nexists a mismatch between the intentions of researchers\\nand human labelers, which may lead to low-quality human\\nfeedback and cause LLMs to produce unexpected output.\\nTo address this issue, InstructGPT [66] further conducts a\\nscreening process to filter labelers by assessing the agree-\\nment between human labelers and researchers. Specifically,\\nresearchers first label a small amount of data and then\\nmeasure the agreement between themselves and human\\nlabelers. The labelers with the highest agreement will be\\nselected to proceed with the subsequent annotation work.\\nIn some other work [370], “super raters” are used to ensure\\nthe high quality of human feedback. Researchers evaluate\\nthe performance of human labelers and select a group of\\nwell-performing human labelers ( e.g., high agreement) as\\nsuper raters. The super raters will be given priority to\\ncollaborate with the researchers in the subsequent study.\\nWhen human labelers annotate the output of LLMs, it is\\nhelpful to specify detailed instructions and provide instant\\nguidance for human labelers, which can further regulate the\\nannotation of labelers.\\nHuman Feedback Collection. In existing work, there are\\nmainly three kinds of approaches to collecting feedback and\\npreference data from human labelers.'),\n",

In early work [367], human\\nlabelers often evaluate model-generated outputs in a coarse-\\ngrained manner (i.e., only selecting the best) without taking\\ninto account more fine-grained alignment criteria. Nonethe-\\nless, different labelers may hold diverse opinions on the\\nselection of the best candidate output, and this method\\ndisregards the unselected samples, which may lead to inac-\\ncurate or incomplete human feedback. To address this issue,\\nsubsequent studies [116] introduce the Elo rating system\\nto derive the preference ranking by comparing candidate\\noutputs. The ranking of outputs serves as the training signal\\nthat guides the model to prefer certain outputs over others,\\nthus inducing outputs that are more reliable and safer.\\n• Question-based approach. Further, human labelers can\\nprovide more detailed feedback by answering certain ques-\\ntions designed by researchers [81], covering the alignment\\ncriteria as well as additional constraints for LLMs. Specially,\\nin WebGPT [81], to assist the model in filtering and utiliz-\\ning relevant information from retrieved documents, human\\nlabelers are required to answer questions with multiple\\noptions about whether the retrieved documents are useful\\nfor answering the given input.\\n• Rule-based approach. Many studies also develop rule-\\nbased methods to provide more detailed human feedback.\\nAs a typical case, Sparrow [116] not only selects the response\\nthat labelers consider the best but also uses a series of\\nrules to test whether model-generated responses meet the\\nalignment criteria of being helpful, correct, and harmless.\\nIn this way, two kinds of human feedback data can be ob-\\ntained: (1) the response preference feedback is obtained by\\ncomparing the quality of model-generated output in pairs,\\nand (2) the rule violation feedback is obtained by collecting\\nthe assessment from human labelers ( i.e., a score indicating\\nto what extent the generated output has violated the rules).\\nFurthermore, GPT-4 [46] utilizes a set of zero-shot classifiers\\n(based on GPT-4 itself) as rule-based reward models, which\\ncan automatically determine whether the model-generated\\noutputs violate a set of human-written rules.\\nIn the following, we focus on a well-known technique,\\nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF),\\nwhich has been widely used in the recent powerful LLMs\\nsuch as ChatGPT. As discussed below, the alignment criteria\\nintroduced in Section 5.2.1 can be fulfilled by learning from\\nhuman feedback on the responses of LLMs to users’ queries.\\n5.2.3 Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\\nTo align LLMs with human values, reinforcement learning\\nfrom human feedback (RLHF) [79, 367] has been proposed\\nto fine-tune LLMs with the collected human feedback data,\\nwhich is useful to improve the alignment criteria ( e.g.,\\nhelpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness). RLHF employs\\nreinforcement learning (RL) algorithms ( e.g., Proximal Pol-\\nicy Optimization (PPO) [128]) to adapt LLMs to human\\nfeedback by learning a reward model. Such an approach\\nincorporates humans in the training loop for developing\\nwell-aligned LLMs, as exemplified by InstructGPT [66].\\nRLHF System. The RLHF system mainly comprises three\\nkey components: a pre-trained LM to be aligned, a reward\\nmodel learning from human feedback, and a RL algorithm\\ntraining the LM. Specifically, the pre-trained LM is typically\\nHuman  \\nAnnotator\\nDemonstration Data\\nSupervised Fine-tuning\\nReward Model Training\\nRL Fine-tuning\\nPrompts  \\nLM Outputs  Training with RL algorithm (PPO)\\nRanking Training with feedback data\\nTraining with demonstration data\\nPre-trained LM\\n🧊\\nPre-trained LM\\n🔥\\nAligned LM🔥\\nReward\\n😊 / 😞\\n Reward  \\nModel\\n🔥\\n Reward  \\nModel\\n🧊\\nDemonstrations   \\nPrompts  \\nLM Outputs  Prompts  \\nHuman Feedback\\nFig. 12: The workflow of the RLHF algorithm.\\na generative model that is initialized with existing pre-\\ntrained LM parameters. For example, OpenAI uses 175B\\nGPT-3 for its first popular RLHF model, InstructGPT [66],\\nand DeepMind uses the 280 billion parameter model Go-\\npher [64] for its GopherCite model [370]. Further, the reward\\nmodel (RM) provides (learned) guidance signals that reflect\\nhuman preferences for the text generated by the LM, usually\\nin the form of a scalar value. The reward model can take on\\ntwo forms: a fine-tuned LM or a LM trained de novo using\\nhuman preference data. Existing work typically employs\\nreward models having a parameter scale different from that\\nof the aligned LM [66, 370]. For example, OpenAI uses 6B\\nGPT-3 and DeepMind uses 7B Gopher as the reward model,\\nrespectively. Finally, to optimize the pre-trained LM using\\nthe signal from the reward model, a specific RL algorithm\\nis designed for large-scale model tuning. Specifically, Prox-\\nimal Policy Optimization (PPO) [128] is a widely used RL\\nalgorithm for alignment in existing work [66, 116, 370].\\nKey Steps for RLHF. Figure 12 illustrates the overall three-\\nstep process of RLHF [66] as introduced below.\\n• Supervised fine-tuning. To make the LM initially perform\\ndesired behaviors, it usually needs to collect a supervised\\ndataset containing input prompts (instruction) and desired\\noutputs for fine-tuning the LM. These prompts and outputs\\ncan be written by human labelers for some specific tasks\\nwhile ensuring the diversity of tasks. For example, Instruct-\\nGPT [66] asks human labelers to compose prompts ( e.g.,\\n“List five ideas for how to regain enthusiasm for my career ”) and\\ndesired outputs for several generative tasks such as open\\nQA, brainstorming, chatting, and rewriting. Note that the\\nfirst step is optional in specific settings or scenarios.\\n• Reward model training. The second step is to train the\\nRM using human feedback data. Specifically, we employ\\nthe LM to generate a certain number of output texts using\\nsampled prompts (from either the supervised dataset or\\nthe human-generated prompt) as input. We then invite'),\n",

Then, the RM is trained to predict\\nthe human-preferred output. In InstructGPT, labelers rank\\nmodel-generated outputs from best to worst, and the RM\\n(i.e., 6B GPT-3) is trained to predict the ranking. Note that, in\\nrecent work [371], the annotation of preference on response\\npairs has been conducted by an AI agent (usually an aligned\\nLLM) instead of humans, which is called “ reinforcement\\nlearning from AI feedback (RLAIF)”. LLMs trained with typical\\nRLHF algorithms tend to generate harmless responses with\\nless helpfulness, which is called evasion problem [371]. To\\nguarantee both the harmlessness and helpfulness, RLAIF\\ngenerates the AI feedback based on pre-set alignment prin-\\nciples in instructions [371, 372], which can also reduce the\\nefforts of human annotation.\\n• RL fine-tuning. At this step, aligning ( i.e., fine-tuning)\\nthe LM is formalized as an RL problem. In this setting,\\nthe pre-trained LM acts as the policy that takes as input\\na prompt and returns an output text, the action space of\\nit is the vocabulary, the state is the currently generated\\ntoken sequence, and the reward is provided by the RM. To\\navoid eviating significantly from the initial (before tuning)\\nLM, a penalty term is commonly incorporated into the\\nreward function. For example, InstructGPT optimizes the\\nLM against the RM using the PPO algorithm. For each input\\nprompt, InstructGPT calculates the KL divergence between\\nthe generated results from the current LM and the initial\\nLM as the penalty. It is noted that the second and final steps\\ncan be iterated in multiple turns for better aligning LLMs.\\nDue to the instability of the RL algorithm, recent work [373]\\nreplaces the RL tuning with another supervised fine-tuning\\nby reusing the best ranked samples with higher rewards.\\nPractical Strategies for RLHF. Although RLHF is promising\\nto effectively improve the alignment of LLMs with humans,\\nit is practically challenging for researchers to successfully\\nimplement it. In this part, we focus on discussing several\\nuseful strategies and tricks for improving the effectiveness\\nand efficiency of RLHF. Concretely, we focus on the effective\\ntraining of reward models, efficient and effective RL train-\\ning, respectively.\\n• Effective reward model training. Despite that InstructGPT\\nused a small reward model (6B GPT model), increasing\\nwork [99] has shown it is often more effective to use a\\nlarge reward model ( e.g., equal or greater than the original\\nmodel size), since large reward models generally perform\\nbetter in judging the quality of the LLM generated outputs.\\nIn LLaMa 2 [99], pretrained chat model checkpoints are\\nused to initialize the reward model, they argue that such an\\napproach can effectively reduce the information mismatch\\nbetween the model to be aligned and the reward model\\nby sharing the same pre-training knowledge. Whereas, it is\\ncommon to encounter the overfitting problem when train-\\ning large-scale reward models. As a simple yet effective\\nsolution, existing work [374, 375] has introduced the LM\\nloss on the preferred response of the input prompt from\\nthe human-annotated alignment dataset as a regularizer,\\nwhich alleviates the overfitting of the reward model on the\\nbinary classification task. In addition, as there are multiple\\ncriteria for alignment ( e.g., helpfulness and honesty), it is\\noften difficult to train a single reward model that can satisfy\\nall the alignment criteria. Therefore, it is useful to train\\nmultiple reward models that focus on different alignment\\ncriteria [99], and compute the final reward based on the\\nproduced ones from them via special combination strategies\\n(e.g., mean pooling and weighted sum). Such a way enables\\nmore flexible rules or standards on multiple criteria, e.g.,\\nrelaxing the requirement on helpfulness while posing more\\nstrict limits on harmfulness.\\n• Effective RL training. As the RL training process tends to\\nbe unstable and hyper-parameter sensitive, it is suggested\\nthat the language model should be well supervised fine-\\ntuned before RL training, so as to reaching a good model\\ncapacity. A commonly-used way is to fine-tune the LLM\\non its best outputs of the prompts (referred to as rejec-\\ntion sampling or best-of-N) from the alignment dataset until\\nconvergence before RL. Given a prompt, the LLM would\\nfirst produce N outputs via the sampling algorithm, and\\nthen the best candidate from the model will be selected\\nby the reward model for learning. After fine-tuning the\\nLLM on the best samples until convergence, the RL process\\nwill be performed to further improve the performance.\\nLLaMA 2 [99] has successively trained five versions of RLHF\\nmodels, where the LLM has been progressively improved\\nwith the improvement of the reward models. In this way,\\nthe collected prompts and annotations of human preference\\ndata can better reflect the issues of the current model check-\\npoint, thus making special tuning to address these issues. In\\naddition, LLaMA 2 also adds samples from prior iterations\\ninto the subsequent ones, to alleviate the possible capacity\\nregression issue during iterative optimization.\\n• Efficient RL training.

In addition, as\\nRLHF requires the LLM to generate multiple candidate\\noutputs, instead of calling the sample decoding procedure\\nfor multiple times, it is more efficient to utilize the beam\\nsearch decoding algorithm26. It only needs to perform one-\\npass decoding for response generation, meanwhile such a\\nstrategy can also enhance the diversity of the generated\\ncandidate responses.\\nProcess-Supervised RLHF. In existing literature of\\nRLHF [376], the supervision signals for RL training can be\\ngenerally classified into two distinct categories: outcome-\\nsupervision signals and process-supervision signals. The\\noutcome-supervised RLHF employs a quantitative score to\\nassess the quality of the whole text generated by LLMs.\\nIn contrast, process-supervised RLHF offers an evalua-\\ntion of each individual component ( e.g., sentence, word,\\nor reasoning step) within the generated content, which\\ncan provide fine-grained supervision signals to guide the\\ntraining, helping LLMs refine the undesired generation\\ncontents [376, 377]. OpenAI has proposed a fine-grained\\nannotation dataset named PRM800k [377] consisting of\\n12K process-annotated mathematical problems ( i.e., MATH\\ndataset [378]) and 75K solutions generated by LLMs of\\nthese problems, where each reasoning step of mathemat-\\nical problems is labeled as positive, negative or neutral in\\nPRM800k. This fine-grained dataset has been utilized in\\nexisting work [377, 379] to train the process-supervised re-\\nward models (PRM), and the probability from the prediction\\nof each label can be considered as the supervision signals\\nduring RLHF procedure. To effectively leverage process-\\nsupervision signals from PRMs, existing work [376] has\\nutilized expert iteration [380, 381], an effective RL algo-\\nrithm to improve the base policy via learning from expert\\npolicy. Typically, expert iteration contains two main stages:\\npolicy improvement and distillation [376]. In the policy\\nimprovement stage, expert policy processes the systematic\\nsearch procedure to produce the samples. PRMs provide\\nprocess-supervision signals to guide expert policy in the\\nsearch procedure and enhance the quality of samples. Subse-\\nquently, during the distillation stage, the samples generated\\nby expert policy in the first stage are utilized to improve\\nthe base policy through supervised fine-tuning. In addition\\nto expert iteration, PRMs can also be utilized to re-rank the\\ncandidates of the final answers generated by LLMs [377] or\\nto select better intermediate reasoning steps during step by\\nstep reasoning [379, 382].\\n5.2.4 Alignment without RLHF\\nAlthough RLHF has achieved great success in aligning the\\nbehaviors of LLMs with human values and preferences, it\\nalso suffers from notable limitations. First, RLHF needs to\\ntrain multiple LMs including the model being aligned, the\\n26. https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.31.0/en/main\\nclasses/text generation#transformers.GenerationMixin.group beam\\nsearch\\nreward model, and the reference model at the same time,\\nwhich is tedious in algorithmic procedure and memory-\\nconsuming in practice. Besides, the commonly-used PPO\\nalgorithm in RLHF is rather complex and often sensitive\\nto hyper-parameters. As an alternative, increasing studies\\nexplore to directly optimize LLMs to adhere to human pref-\\nerences, using supervised fine-tuning without reinforcement\\nlearning [349].\\nOverview. The basic idea of non-RL alignment approaches\\nis to directly fine-tune LLMs with supervised learning on\\nhigh-quality alignment dataset . It basically assumes that re-\\nsponse feedback or golden rules to avert unsafe behaviors\\nhave been injected or included in the specially curated align-\\nment dataset, so that LLMs can directly learn aligned behav-\\niors from these demonstration data via suitable fine-tuning\\nstrategies. Thus, to implement this approach, two key issues\\nare the construction of alignment dataset and the design of\\nfine-tuning loss. For the first issue, the alignment dataset\\ncan be automatically constructed by an aligned LLMs ac-\\ncording to human-written safety principles [347] or refining\\nexisting examples using edits operations [383]. In addition,\\nwe can also reuse existing reward models to select high-\\nrated responses from existing human feedback data [373].\\nFor the second issue, non-RL alignment approaches mainly\\nfine-tune LLMs in a supervised learning way (the same\\nas the original instruction tuning loss) on a high-quality\\nalignment dataset, meanwhile auxiliary learning objectives\\ncan be used to enhance the alignment performance, e.g.,\\nranking responses or contrasting instruction-response pairs.\\nAlignment Data Collection. The construction of alignment\\ndata is important to effectively align the behaviors of LLMs\\nwith human preferences. To collect high-quality alignment\\ndata, some work tries to reuse existing reward models to\\nselect high-rated responses, and others explore to leverage\\npowerful LLMs ( e.g., ChatGPT) or build a simulated envi-\\nronment to generate synthetic alignment examples. Next,\\nwe will discuss these three lines of research.\\n• Reward model based approaches. The reward model in\\nRLHF has been trained to measure the alignment degree\\non the responses of LLMs. It is straightforward to leverage\\nexisting reward models to select high-quality responses as\\nalignment data for subsequent fine-tuning. Based on this\\nidea, RAFT [373] adopts reward models trained on human\\npreference data to rank the responses of LLMs and collect\\nthose with higher rewards for supervised fine-tuning. In\\naddition, the reward model can be also used to score model\\nresponses and assign them to different quality groups.\\nQuark [384] sorts the responses of LLMs into different quan-\\ntiles based on the reward scores. Each quantile is attached\\nwith a special reward token to represent the reward level\\nof the quantile. Conditioned on the highest-reward tokens,\\nLLMs are subsequently prompted to generate high-quality\\nresponses. Given an initial answer and the corresponding\\nhuman feedback, ILF [385] first adopts LLMs to generate\\nrefined answers, then utilizes the reward model to select\\nthe answer that best matches the feedback for further\\ntraining. As valuable resources for aligning LLMs, several\\nreward models have been released, including DeBERTa-'),\n",

Reward models help\\nto select aligned data from model responses. However,\\ntraining reward models itself necessitates substantial high-\\nquality human-labeled data, which is typically expensive\\nand in short supply. In addition, although existing reward\\nmodels can be reused, they might not be able to accurately\\ncapture the nonalignment behaviors in another separately\\ntrained LLM. Therefore, some work explores leveraging\\npowerful LLMs to automatically generate human-aligned\\ndata. As a representative work, constitutional AI [371] pro-\\nposes that human supervision comes from a set of principles\\n(i.e., natural language instructions) governing AI behaviors.\\nBased on these principles, LLMs will critique their own\\nharmful responses and revise them repeatedly into finally\\naligned responses. Similarly, Self-Align [347] first adopts\\nself-instruct [143] to generate instructions focusing on cov-\\nering diverse topics. Then, the model is also prompted\\nwith multiple human-written principles that describe the\\nrules of expected model behaviors (also with several in-\\ncontext exemplars), to generate helpful, ethical, and reliable\\nresponses as alignment data. To mitigate the limit that the\\noriginal SFT method can only learn from positive responses,\\nFIGA [386] develops an improved supervised alignment\\napproach, where both negative (the original output of low\\nquality) and positive (the refined output by LLMs) re-\\nsponses are leveraged in a contrastive way, to enable LLMs\\nto deeply understand what fine-grained revisions actually\\nlead to good response.\\n• LLM based interactive approaches. Most existing ap-\\nproaches train LLMs in isolation, where LLMs are not\\npresent in actual environments to improve themselves\\nthrough external feedback signals. As a comparison, hu-\\nmans learn social norms and values from interactions with\\nothers in social environments [387]. To mimic such a learn-\\ning approach, Stable Alignment [179] builds a simulated\\ninteraction environment consisting of a number of LLM\\nagents, where AI agents keep interacting with and each\\nother, receiving feedback on improvement. Once a central\\nagent receives an instruction, it produces a response and\\nshares it with nearby agents. These critic agents generate\\nfeedback comprising ratings about the response and re-\\nvision suggestions. Then the central agent would revise\\nthe original response following these suggestions. Such\\nan alignment approach can be also extended to real-world\\nenvironment with humans.\\nSupervised Alignment T uning. After obtaining alignment\\ndata, it is also key to design suitable fine-tuning strategies\\nfor direct alignment. A straightforward approach is to op-\\ntimize LLMs using the conventional sequence-to-sequence\\nobjective based on the alignment data. In addition to the\\nconventional optimization objective, several studies further\\nexplore auxiliary losses that enhance the learning from the\\nalignment data.\\n• Primary training objective. Since the alignment data\\ntypically consists of an input instruction and an output re-\\n27. https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant\\n28. https://github.com/OpenLMLab/MOSS-RLHF\\n29. https://huggingface.co/stanfordnlp/SteamSHP-flan-t5-xl\\nsponse, the primary training loss is still the traditional cross-\\nentropy loss for sequence-to-sequence learning. Based on\\nthis loss, many studies propose a number of improvement\\nvariants for enhancing the supervised alignment tuning.\\nFor example, CoH [388] constructs the training data by\\nprepending “A helpful answer: ” and “ An unhelpful answer: ”\\nto the annotated good and bad responses, respectively, and\\nonly compute losses for those response tokens with special\\nmasking. Quark [384] sorts model responses into different\\nquantiles with varying alignment quality, it prepends a\\nspecial reward token to each model response to represent\\nthe reward level of the response. Further, to enable the\\npreference modeling via the maximum likelihood objective,\\nDPO [389] first reparameterizes the response rewards using\\nthe policy model (i.e., the language model being optimized),\\nand then the original reward modelling objective can be\\nreformulated only based on the policy model. In this way,\\nDPO removes the explicit reward modeling step, and opti-\\nmizing the new learning objective only involving the policy\\nmodel is equivalent to optimizing the rewards. Furthermore,\\nFIGA [386] designs a fine-grained contrastive loss that aims\\nto encourage desirable tokens, penalize undesirable ones,\\nand disregard trivial tokens.\\n• Auxiliary optimization objectives. Besides the primary\\ncross-entropy loss, several studies propose auxiliary train-\\ning loss to enhance the learning from the alignment data.\\nFirst, since the responses of each instruction can be scored\\nby the reward model, the ranking loss can be used to train\\nthe model to preserve the ranking order of these responses.\\nFor example, RRHF [390] samples responses from multi-\\nple sources, including model-generated responses, such as\\nthose derived from the model itself, ChatGPT, and GPT-4,\\nas well as human-written responses, spanning both high-\\nquality and low-quality instances. To align with the scores\\nfrom reward models, it further optimizes the ranking loss\\nby encouraging the model to have a higher conditional log\\nprobability for the response with a higher ranking. SLiC-\\nHF [391] proposes to assess the similarity between model\\noutputs and human preference via the distance in the latent\\nspace, and introduces specific calibration and regularization\\nloss to calibrate the candidate sequences based on human-\\npreference data. Second, to enhance the relatedness be-\\ntween the response and the instruction, some work adopts\\ncontrastive learning to push up the probability of correct\\ninstruction-response pairs while pushing down incorrect\\ninstruction-response pairs. Specifically, for an output re-\\nsponse, the proposed approach in [392] contrasts the target\\ninstruction to the other irrelevant instructions. By doing so,\\nit can enable the model to learn the right correlation between\\ninstructions and responses.\\n5.2.5 Remarks on SFT and RLHF\\nAs discussed in Section 5.1, instruction tuning is the process\\nof training pre-trained language models with formatted\\ndemonstration data (instructions paired with desired out-\\nputs). At early exploration, instruction data was mainly col-\\nlected from NLP tasks [67], while it has been now extended\\nto more diverse supervision data that pairs input and\\noutput texts ( e.g., the utterances of open-ended dialogues).\\nTraining with such paired texts is also called supervised fine-\\ntuning (SFT) in the context of LLMs [66]. In this part, we'),\n",

Next, we make some\\ndiscussions on this issue30.\\nOverall Comparison with RL Formulation . Following the\\ndiscussion in Section 5.2.3 (the part related to RL training),\\nthe text generation problem can be formulated as a decision-\\nmaking process based on RL. Taking a prompt as input,\\nthe task of a LLM is to generate a text completion that\\nappropriately responds to the prompt. This task would be\\ncompleted step by step. At each step, an agent ( i.e., LLM)\\nwill perform an action ( i.e., generating a token) according\\nto the policy ( i.e., the generative probability distribution of\\nLLM) conditioned on the current state (currently generated\\ntoken sequence and other available context information).\\nIt is expected that a high-quality output text would be\\nproduced by the LLM, which can earn a large reward score\\nbased on the entire response. Overall, RLHF and SFT can be\\nconsidered as two different training approaches to optimiz-\\ning the above decision making process for LLMs. Specially,\\nRLHF firstly learns the reward model, and then employs\\nit to improve the LLM with RL training ( e.g., PPO). As a\\ncomparison, SFT adopts a teacher-forcing approach, which\\ndirectly optimizes the likelihood of a demonstration output.\\nSuch a token-level training way essentially does behavior\\ncloning (a special algorithm of imitation learning [393]): it\\nutilizes the expert’s action (i.e., the target token at each step)\\nas the supervision label and directly learns to imitate the\\ndemonstrations from experts without specifying a reward\\nmodel as in typical RL algorithms. To learn the desired\\npolicies, SFT adopts a “local” optimization way ( i.e., token-\\nlevel loss) based on demonstration data, while RLHF takes a\\n“global” optimization way (i.e., text-level loss) by involving\\nhuman preference. More theoretical analysis about imitation\\nlearning and reinforcement learning can be referred to the\\nrelated RL literature [393, 394].\\nPros and Cons of SFT . SFT has been shown to be an\\neffective approach to boosting the performance of LLMs\\non various benchmarks [67, 69, 137, 138], which can largely\\nenhance the task generalization ability and flexibly endow\\nspecific functions ( e.g., establishing the chatbot’s identity).\\nMore discussions about the usefulness of SFT can be found\\nin Section 5.1.3. It has been widely recognized that SFT\\nmainly unlocks the abilities but not inject new abilities into\\nLLMs. Thus, it might become problematic when one tries\\nto stimulate the non-endogenous abilities of LLMs via SFT.\\nAs a concrete scenario, it would potentially advocate the\\nhallucination behaviors when demonstration data is beyond\\nthe knowledge or ability scope of LLMs, e.g., training a LLM\\nto answer questions about its unknown facts. An interesting\\nviewpoint from John Schulman’s talk on RLHF [395] is that\\ndistilling superior models to train less capable models ( e.g.,\\nprompting GPT-4 to generate the response as fine-tuning\\ndata) might increase the possibilities of generating the hal-\\n30. This part would be somehow subjective, mainly based on the au-\\nthors’ opinions and experiences. Comments or corrections are welcome\\nto enhance this part.\\nlucinated texts, thus likely affecting the factual accuracy\\nof LLMs. Furthermore, as a behavior cloning method, SFT\\naims to imitate the behaviors (without explorations) of the\\nexperts who construct the demonstration data. However,\\nthere often exist variations among different annotators on\\nthe writing styles, quality, and preferences of demonstration\\ndata, which tends to affect the learning performance of SFT.\\nThus, high-quality instruction data (but not the quantity) is\\nthe primary factor for effective training of LLMs during the\\nSFT stage [99].\\nPros and Cons of RLHF . RLHF was early explored in the\\nliterature of deep RL [79], then borrowed to improve the\\ncapacity of language models ( e.g., summarization [129]),\\nand subsequently adopted as the fundamental technique to\\ndevelop InstructGPT [66]. Recently, increasing evidence [99,\\n371] has demonstrated the effectiveness of RLHF in miti-\\ngating the harmful responses and enhancing the model ca-\\npacity. Specially, LLaMA 2 has demonstrated that RLHF can\\nimprove both the helpfulness and harmlessness scores [99],\\nand attributed this to a better human-LLM synergy for data\\nannotation. They explain this reason in two major aspects\\nas follows. First, since human annotators mainly provide\\npreference annotations for RLHF, it can largely alleviate the\\ndiscrepancies of annotators as that in SFT. Secondly, pref-\\nerence annotation is much easier than writing the demon-\\nstration data, and annotators can even judge the quality of\\nmore superior generations than those they create, making it\\npossible to explore a broader state space beyond what can\\nbe demonstrated by human annotators. Another key point\\nis that RLHF essentially encourages LLMs to learn correct\\npolicies by contrasting the self-generated responses (dis-\\ncriminating between good and bad responses). It no longer\\nforces the model to imitate external demonstration data,\\nand thus can mitigate the hallucination issues with SFT as\\ndiscussed above31. Actually, RLHF has been demonstrated\\nto be an important approach to reduce the hallucination\\nbehaviors in GPT-4 [46]. However, RLHF inherits the draw-\\nbacks of classic RL algorithms, e.g., sample inefficiency and\\ntraining instability. When adapted to LLMs, RLHF further\\nrelies on a strong SFT model as initial model checkpoint for\\nefficiently achieving good performance. In addition, human\\nannotators are involved in a complex iterative optimization\\nprocess, in which a number of important details ( e.g., the\\nprompt selection, the schedule of reward model training and\\nPPO training, and the settings of hyper-parameters) have\\nimportant impact on the whole model performance.\\nOverall, SFT is particularly useful to increase the model\\ncapacity of pre-trained model checkpoints right after pre-\\ntraining, while RLHF is promising to further improve the\\nmodel capacity of SFT models. However, RLHF has been\\ndifficult to implement, and far from well explored (ac-\\ncording to public literature), and more improvements ( e.g.,\\nefficient and reliable annotation [371] and simplified opti-\\nmization [389]) are still needed for further research.\\n31. In RLHF, it seems to be also important that reward models\\nshould be aware of the knowledge or ability of a LLM to be aligned.\\nFor example, LLaMA 2 adopts pre-trained chat model checkpoints to\\ninitialize reward models [99].'),\n",

Since LLMs consist of a huge amount of\\nmodel parameters, it would be costly to perform the full-\\nparameter tuning. In this section, we will discuss how to\\nconduct efficient tuning on LLMs. We first review several\\nrepresentative parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for\\nTransformer language models, and then summarize existing\\nwork on parameter-efficient fine-tuned LLMs.\\n5.3.1 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Methods\\nIn existing literature, parameter-efficient fine-tuning [145,\\n396, 397] has been an important topic that aims to reduce\\nthe number of trainable parameters while retaining a good\\nperformance as possible. In what follows, we briefly re-\\nview four parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for Trans-\\nformer language models, including adapter tuning, prefix\\ntuning, prompt tuning and LoRA. The illustration of these\\nfour methods are shown in Figure 13.\\nAdapter T uning. Adapter tuning incorporates small neural\\nnetwork modules (called adapter) into the Transformer mod-\\nels [398]. To implement the adapter module, a bottleneck\\narchitecture has been proposed in [398, 399], which first\\ncompresses the original feature vector into a smaller di-\\nmension (followed by a nonlinear transformation) and then\\nrecovers it to the original dimension. The adapter modules\\nwould be integrated into each Transformer layer, typically\\nusing a serial insertion after each of the two core parts ( i.e.,\\nattention layer and feed-forward layer) of a Transformer\\nlayer. Alternatively, parallel adapters [400] can be also used\\nin Transformer layers, where it places two adapter modules\\nin parallel with the attention layer and feed-forward layer\\naccordingly. During fine-tuning, the adapter modules would\\nbe optimized according to the specific task goals, while the\\nparameters of the original language model are frozen in this\\nprocess. In this way, we can effectively reduce the number\\nof trainable parameters during fine-tuning.\\nPrefix T uning. Prefix tuning [396] prepends a sequence of\\nprefixes, which are a set of trainable continuous vectors, to\\neach Transformer layer in language models. These prefix\\nvectors are task-specific, which can be considered as virtual\\ntoken embeddings. To optimize the prefix vectors, a repa-\\nrameterization trick [396] has been proposed by learning a\\nMLP function that maps a smaller matrix to the parameter\\nmatrix of prefixes, instead of directly optimizing the pre-\\nfixes. It has been shown that this trick is useful for stable\\ntraining. After optimization, the mapping function would\\nbe discarded, and only the derived prefix vectors are kept\\nto enhance task-specific performance. Since only the prefix\\nparameters would be trained, it can lead to a parameter-\\nefficient model optimization. Similar to prefix tuning, p-\\ntuning v2 [401] incorporates layer-wise prompt vectors into\\nthe Transformer architecture specially for natural language\\nunderstanding, which also utilizes multi-task learning for\\njointly optimizing shared prompts. It has been shown to\\nbe useful in improving the model performance of different\\nparameter scales on natural language understanding tasks.\\nPrompt T uning. Different from prefix tuning, prompt tun-\\ning [397, 402] mainly focuses on incorporating trainable\\nprompt vectors at the input layer 32. Based on the discrete\\nprompting methods [404, 405], it augments the input text\\nby including a group of soft prompt tokens (either in a\\nfree form [402] or a prefix form [397]), and then takes\\nthe prompt-augmented input to solve specific downstream\\ntasks. In implementation, task-specific prompt embeddings\\nare combined with the input text embeddings, which are\\nsubsequently fed into language models. P-tuning [402] has\\nproposed a free form to combine the context, prompt and\\ntarget tokens, which can be applied to the architectures for\\nboth natural language understanding and generation. They\\nfurther learn the representations of soft prompt tokens by a\\nbidirectional LSTM. Another representative approach [397]\\nnamed prompt tuning directly prepends prefix prompts to\\nthe input. During training, only the prompt embeddings\\nwould be learned according to task-specific supervisions.\\nSince this method only includes a small number of trainable\\nparameters at the input layer, it has been found that the\\nperformance highly relies on the model capacity of the\\nunderlying language models [397].\\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) . LoRA [145] imposes the\\nlow-rank constraint for approximating the update matrix at\\neach dense layer, so as to reduce the trainable parameters\\nfor adapting to downstream tasks. Consider the case of\\noptimizing a parameter matrix W. The update process can\\nbe written in a general form as: W ← W + ∆W. The basic\\nidea of LoRA is to freeze the original matrix W ∈ Rm×n\\nwhile approximating the parameter update ∆W by low-\\nrank decomposition matrices, i.e., ∆W = A · B⊤, where\\nA ∈ Rm×k and B ∈ Rn×k are the trainable parameters for\\ntask adaptation and k ≪ min(m, n) is the reduced rank. The\\nmajor merit of LoRA is that it can largely save the memory\\nand storage usage ( e.g., VRAM). Further, one can only keep\\na single large model copy, while maintaining a number of\\ntask-specific low-rank decomposition matrices for adapting\\nto different downstream tasks. Further, several studies have\\nalso discussed how to set the rank in a more principled\\napproach, e.g., importance score based allocation [406] and\\nsearch-free optimal rank selection [407].\\nBesides the above methods, there is extensive research\\non efficient tuning of Transformer language models. How-\\never, a more comprehensive discussion of efficient tuning is\\nbeyond the scope of this article, which can be found in the\\nrelated papers on this topic [400, 408].\\n5.3.2 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning on LLMs\\nWith the rising of LLMs, efficient tuning has attracted\\nincreasing research attention for developing a more\\nlightweight adaptation approach in downstream tasks.\\nIn particular, LoRA [145] has been widely applied\\nto open-source LLMs ( e.g., LLaMA and BLOOM) for\\n32. Here, prompt tuning denotes a category of related efficient tuning\\nmethods exemplified by the work [397, 402, 403], instead of a spe-\\ncific method as used in [397]. Indeed, the prefix based tuning meth-\\nods [396, 401] can be also considered as prompting methods, which\\nare called deep prompting tuning in [401]. In this survey, prompt tuning\\nspecially refer to the methods that only include the prompt tokens at\\nthe input layer, in the context of LLMs. We assign p-tuning v2 [401] to\\nthe category of prefix tuning, because it incorporates layerwise prompts\\nin langauge models.'),\n",

However, most of these approaches are tested\\non small-sized pre-trained language models, instead of the\\nLLMs. So far, there still lacks a thorough investigation on\\nthe effect of different efficient tuning methods on large-sized\\nlanguage models at different settings or tasks.\\n5.4 Memory-Efficient Model Adaptation\\nDue to the huge number of model parameters, LLMs take a\\nsignificant memory footprint for inference, making it very\\ncostly to be deployed in real-world applications. In this\\nsection, we discuss how to reduce the memory footprint\\nof LLMs via a popular model compression approach ( i.e.,\\nmodel quantization), so that large-sized LLMs can be used\\nin resource-limited settings, which also likely reduces the\\ninference latency.\\n5.4.1 Background for Quantization\\nIn this part, we present a general introduction of quantiza-\\ntion techniques for neural networks.\\n33. https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora\\n34. https://github.com/huggingface/peft\\nIn neural network compression, quantization often refers\\nto the mapping process from floating-point numbers to\\nintegers [412], especially the 8-bit integer quantization ( i.e.,\\nINT8 quantization ). For neural network models, there are\\ntypically two kinds of data to be quantized, namely weights\\n(model parameters) and activations (hidden activations),\\nwhich are originally represented in floating-point num-\\nbers. To illustrate the essential idea of model quantization,\\nwe introduce a simple yet popular quantization function:\\nxq = R(x/S)−Z, which transforms a floating numberx into\\na quantized value xq. In this function, S and Z denote the\\nscaling factor (involving two parameters α and β that deter-\\nmine the clipping range) and zero-point factor (determining\\nsymmetric or asymmetric quantization), respectively, and\\nR(·) denotes the rounding operation that maps a scaled\\nfloating value to an approximate integer.\\nAs the reverse process, dequantization recovers the orig-\\ninal value from the quantized value accordingly: ˜x =\\nS · (xq + Z). The quantization error is calculated as the\\nnumerical difference between the original value x and the\\nrecovered value ˜x. The range parameters α and β have a\\nlarge impact on the quantization performance, which often\\nneed to be calibrated according to real data distributions, in\\neither a static (offline) or dynamic way (runtime).\\nFor more details, we refer to the readers to the excel-\\nlent survey [412] about quantization methods on neural\\nnetworks.\\n5.4.2 Quantization Methods for LLMs\\nThere are generally two major model quantization ap-\\nproaches, namely quantization-aware training (QAT) (requir-\\ning additional full model retraining) andpost-training quanti-\\nzation (PTQ) (requires no model retraining). Compared with\\nsmall-sized language models, two major differences need\\nto be considered when designing or selecting quantization\\nmethods for LLMs. Firstly, LLMs consist of a huge number\\nof parameters, and thus PTQ methods are more preferred\\ndue to a much lower computational cost than QAT methods.\\nSecondly, LLMs exhibit very different activation patterns\\n(i.e., large outlier features), and it becomes more difficult\\nto quantize LLMs, especially hidden activations. Next, we\\nwill briefly review several representative PTQ methods35 for\\nLLMs.\\nPost-Training Quantization (PTQ) . We first introduce the\\nPTQ methods for LLMs.\\n• Mixed-precision decomposition . As observed in [413],\\nextreme large values occur in hidden activations (called\\nthe emergence of outliers ) when the model size reaches 6.7B\\nparameters or above. Interestingly, these outliers are mainly\\ndistributed in some specific feature dimensions at Trans-\\nformer layers. Based on this finding, a vector-wise quan-\\ntization approach, called LLM.int8(), has been proposed in\\n[413], which separates the feature dimensions with outliers\\nand the rest dimensions in matrix multiplication. Then,\\nthe calculations for the two parts are performed with 16-\\nbit floating numbers and 8-bit integers , respectively, so as to\\nrecover these outliers in a high precision.\\n35. Since we mainly focus on discussing quantization methods in the\\ncontext of LLMs, the line of quantization work on small-sized language\\nmodels (e.g., BERT) has not been included in this survey.'),\n",

For Transformer models,\\nweights and activations are usually represented in the\\nform of tensors. A straightforward approach is to use\\ncoarse-grained quantization parameters for the whole ten-\\nsor ( i.e., per-tensor quantization) [414]. However, it usu-\\nally leads to inaccurate reconstruction results. Thus, fine-\\ngrained methods are proposed to reduce the quantization\\nerror. ZeroQuant [415] adopts a token-wise quantization\\napproach with dynamic calibration for compressing acti-\\nvations. Whereas for weights (easier to be quantized), it\\nuses a group-wise quantization. In practice, a group size\\nof 128 [415, 416] is commonly used for model quantization.\\n• Balancing the quantization difficulty . Considering that\\nweights are easier to be quantized than activations,\\nSmoothQuant [414] proposes to migrate the difficulty from\\nactivations to weights. Specially, they incorporate a scaling\\ntransformation to balance the difficulty between weights\\nand activations in a linear layer: Y = ( Xdiag(s)−1) ·\\n(diag(s)W). By introducing an mathematically equivalent\\ntransformation, this formula controls the quantization diffi-\\nculty through the scaling factor s. To set s, it incorporates\\na migration strength parameter α to balance the difficulties,\\nwhere each entry sj = max( xj)α/ max(wj)(1−α) is deter-\\nmined by the migration strength.\\n• Layerwise quantization . This approach finds optimal\\nquantized weights that minimize a layerwise reconstruction\\nloss: arg mincW ∥ WX− cWX ∥2\\n2. To efficiently optimize this\\nobjective, GPTQ [417] improves the original optimal brain\\nquantization (OBQ) [418] method by fixing the quantiza-\\ntion order of weights for all rows. Further, with specially\\ndesigned methods ( i.e., lazy batch-updates and Cholesky\\nreformulation), GPTQ is feasible to quantize very large\\nmodels (e.g., 175B OPT) in 3 or 4 bit precision. More recently,\\nAWQ [416] further simplifies the optimization form by\\nincorporating activation-aware scaling for weights, which\\nresembles the idea of SmoothQuant [414]: weights corre-\\nsponding to outlier activations are more important to be\\nprecisely quantized. It does not directly optimize the recon-\\nstruction loss, but instead performs simple hyper-parameter\\nsearch to achieve the minimal loss on calibration data.\\nThese strategies in the above methods can be jointly\\nused to improve the quantization performance. In order to\\nachieve high-efficiency implementation, quantization meth-\\nods also rely on hardware- or system-level support ( e.g., ef-\\nficient GPU kernels or hardware-friendly group partition).\\nOther Quantization Methods . In the above, we mainly fo-\\ncus on PTQ methods, and next introduce two recent studies\\nthat explore efficient fine-tuning methods or QAT methods\\nfor quanitizing LLMs.\\n• Efficient fine-tuning enhanced quantization. For post-\\ntraining quantization, direct low-bit quantization (e.g., INT4\\nquantization) often results in large performance degrada-\\ntion. To overcome this challenge, QLoRA [419] incorporates\\nadditional small tunable adapters (16-bit precision) into the\\nquantized models, to achieve an efficient, high-precision\\nmodel fine-tuning. It combines the merits of LoRA (See\\nSection 5.3.1) and quantization methods. The experiment\\nresults show that 4-bit quantized models can achieve the\\nfull 16-bit fine-tuning performance by QLoRA.\\n• Quantization-aware training (QAT) for LLMs . A recent\\nstudy [420] explores the effect of QAT methods by applying\\na data-free distillation method to compress the weights,\\nactivations as well as key-value cache. By conducting exten-\\nsive experiments based on LLaMA, they show promising\\nresults with 4-bit quantization on both weights and key-\\nvalue cache, but not on 4-bit activation quantization, which\\nstill needs more exploration.\\n5.4.3 Empirical Analysis and Findings\\nQuantization has currently become a common technique\\nto reduce the memory footprint and latency of LLMs in\\ndeployment. In particular, it is important to understand\\nwhat level of precision ( e.g., INT8 or INT4) can be applied\\nto quantize different parts of LLMs ( e.g., weights or acti-\\nvations), while retaining a high accuracy. In this part, we\\nfirst summarize the major findings about the quantization of\\nLLMs in existing literature, and then present some empirical\\nanalysis with quantization experiments.\\nImportant Findings from Existing Work . Recently, a very\\ncomprehensive evaluation [421] has been conducted about\\nthe impact of multiple factors ( e.g., model size and sensi-\\ntivity) on the post-training quantization methods. Another\\nstudy [422] examines the scaling law of k-bit quantiza-\\ntion in inference performance. In addition to the overall\\nperformance, the study [423] specifically focuses on the\\npotential impact of quantification on emergent capabilities,\\nas well as the levels of performance that can be achieved\\nacross various levels of bit precision. Also, prior work ( e.g.,\\nLLM.int8() [424], GPTQ [417], QLoRA [419], and GLM [93])\\nhas also extensively examined the performance of quanti-\\nzation methods in various settings. Next, we summarize\\nseveral important findings from these studies, which will\\nbe useful for those who may not want to delve into the\\ntechnical details of quantization methods.\\n• INT8 weight quantization can often yield very good re-\\nsults on LLMs, while the performance of lower precision weight\\nquantization depends on specific methods [414, 416, 417, 421]. In\\nmost cases, INT8 weight quantization can be effectively ap-\\nplied to reduce the memory footprint without performance\\ndegradation. While for INT4 (or INT3) weight quantization,\\nexisting methods rely on specific strategies to reduce the\\nperformance degradation, e.g., layerwise method [415, 417],\\nactivation-aware scaling [416] and low-rank adapter tun-\\ning [419]. Interestingly, LLMs seem to be less sensitive\\nto low-bit weight quantization than small-sized language\\nmodels [421]. In practice, with the same memory cost, it\\nis suggested to use a larger language model with a lower\\nquantization precision rather than a smaller language model\\nwith a higher quantization precision. For example, a 4-bit\\n60GB LLM is demonstrated to have better performance than\\na 8-bit 30GB LLM [422]. Moreover, focusing on emergent\\ncapabilities, the study [423] finds that in-context learning,\\nstep-by-step reasoning, and instruction following all seem\\nto be seldom affected with 4-bit weight quantization. This\\nresult suggests that INT4 quantization exhibits a favorable\\ntrade-off in terms of both total bits and performance of\\nemergent abilities.\\n• Activations are more difficult to be quantized than\\nweights [413, 414, 421]. It has been found that large outliers\\nwould occur for Transformer language models having a'),\n",

This issue has been one of\\nthe most fundamental difficulties to quantize LLMs. To\\novercome this issue, various methods, e.g., mixed-precision\\ndecomposition [413], fine-grained quantization [413, 425]\\nand difficulty migration [414], can be applied to alleviate the\\ninfluence of outlier values. Since large outliers mainly exist\\nin the activations of LLMs, small language models are more\\nresistant to activation quantization [421, 423]. In practice,\\nhigh-quality INT8 activation quantization is still a difficult\\ntask, though several methods can attain satisfying results.\\nFurther, lower precision activation quantization has still not\\nbeen successfully explored, even for QAT methods [420].\\n• Efficient fine-tuning enhanced quantization is a good op-\\ntion to enhance the performance of quantized LLMs [145, 419].\\nThe benefits of efficient fune-tuning methods in quanti-\\nzation can be twofold. Firstly, it can directly compensate\\nthe performance degradation suffered from low-bit quan-\\ntization [421, 423], by increasing the fitting capacity by\\nupdating high precision adapters. Secondly, it is flexible to\\nsupport task-specific or goal-specific fine-tuning of LLMs\\nin a lightweight way [419], e.g., instruction tuning or chat-\\noriented tuning, by only tuning the small adapters. Overall,\\nit makes a good trade-off between the effectiveness and\\ntraining cost, which provides a promising approach to en-\\nhancing the performance of quantized LLMs.\\nEmpirical Analysis on Quantization Experiments . To fur-\\nther help readers understand the impact of quantization on\\nLLMs, we also conduct a group of experiments to investi-\\ngate the inference performance of quantized models here.\\nSpecifically, we focus on the fine-tuned LLaMA models (i.e.,\\n7B and 13B) using popular SFT datasets, including FLAN-\\nv2 [69], Alpaca-52K [137] and ShareGPT [148]. For evalua-\\ntion, we utilize the same tasks in Table 9, and follow the\\nquantization settings in the study [423] examining the per-\\nformance of quantized language models at three precision\\nlevels: 4-bit, 8-bit and 16-bit. The results are summarized\\nin Table 10. As can be observed from Table 10, the results\\nobtained with 8-bit and 4-bit weight quantization are close\\nto the performance of 16-bit models while significantly\\nreducing memory consumption. In practice, it is recom-\\nmended to first examine the performance of 4-bit weight\\nquantization for LLMs if reducing memory usage is a critical\\nconsideration for deployment.\\n5.4.4 Open-source Libraries and Quantized LLMs\\nIn this part, we briefly introduce the available open-source\\nquantization libraries and quantized LLMs.\\nQuantization Libraries . Next, we introduce three major\\nquantization libraries for LLMs, including:\\n• Bitsandbytes36 is developed based on the methods intro-\\nduced in the papers of LLM.int8() [413] and 8-bit optimiz-\\ners [426]. It focuses on the quantization of both activations\\nand weights for LLMs, including the support on 8-bit and\\n4-bit (NF4,FP4) matrix multiplication for efficient inference,\\nas well as an 8-bit optimizer for efficient training.\\n• GPTQ-for-LLaMA37 is developed specially for quantiz-\\ning LLaMA models. It enables 4-bit quantization of LLaMA\\n36. https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes\\n37. https://github.com/qwopqwop200/GPTQ-for-LLaMa\\nmodels of varied sizes based on the GPTQ algorithm [417].\\nAlso, it provides a comparison with bitsandbytes in both\\nmemory and performance (PPL) on the project website.\\n• AutoGPTQ38 is a quantization package developed\\nbased on the GPTQ algorithm [417], which supports INT4\\nquantization for LLMs. It includes a number of quantized\\nmodels in the library, and supports LoRA by integrating\\nwith HuggingFace PEFT library.\\n• llama.cpp39 makes it feasible to run quantized LLaMA\\nmodels on a MacBook device. It supports INT4, INT5 and\\nINT8 quantization, which is developed in efficient C/C++\\nimplementation. It also supports a number of LLaMA based\\nmodels, such as Alpaca and Vicuna.\\nQuantized LLMs . Compared with original models, quan-\\ntized language models take a smaller memory footprint,\\nand likely have a faster inference speed [93, 413, 427].\\nRecently, a nubmer of quantized model copies of several\\npublicly available language models have been released on\\nHuggingFace, including BLOOM, GPT-J, and ChatGLM. In\\nparticular, GPTQ [417] has been widely used to quantize\\ngenerative language models, leading to various quantized\\nvariants for LLaMA and OPT. Further, it has been also\\napplied to quantize instruction-tuned models, such as Vi-\\ncuna and WizardLM. Due to the large number of quantized\\nLLMs, we do not directly incorporate the corresponding\\nlinks of these models. The readers can easily find them by\\nsearching on HuggingFace.\\n6 U TILIZATION\\nAfter pre-training or adaptation tuning, a major approach\\nto using LLMs is to design suitable prompting strategies\\nfor solving various tasks. In existing literature, task-specific\\nprompts can be effectively learned through manual creation\\nand automatic optimization. A representative prompting\\nmethod is in-context learning [50, 55], which formulates the\\ntask description and/or demonstrations in the form of natu-\\nral language text. In addition, chain-of-thought prompting [33]\\ncan be employed to enhance in-context learning by involv-\\ning a series of intermediate reasoning steps in prompts.\\nFurthermore, planning [439] is proposed for solving complex\\ntasks, which first breaks them down into smaller sub-tasks\\nand then generates a plan of action to solve these sub-tasks\\none by one. We summarize representative work for these\\nprompting approaches in Table 11. Next, we will elaborate\\non the details of the four techniques.\\n6.1 Prompting\\nAs discussed in previous work [36], prompting is the major\\napproach to utilizing LLMs for solving various tasks. Since\\nthe quality of prompts will largely influence the perfor-\\nmance of LLMs in specific tasks, there have been a series of\\nstudies proposed to generate suitable task prompts through\\nmanual creation or automatic optimization, which will be\\nintroduced in this section.\\n38. https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ\\n39. https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp'),\n",

A well-designed prompt\\nis very helpful to elicit the abilities of LLMs for accomplish-\\ning specific tasks. In this part, we will first introduce the\\nkey components of prompts and discuss several principles\\nfor prompt design. Then, we evaluate ChatGPT with differ-\\nent prompts to show the results on several representative\\ntasks. We are aware that there have been several existing\\npapers [453, 454] and websites [455–457] that present the\\nsuggestions and guidelines to design good prompts. As a\\ncomparison, we mainly aim to discuss the key factors (ingre-\\ndients and principles) that are useful for prompt creation,\\nand provide experimental results and analysis on popular\\ntasks as the reference to the beginners.\\nKey Ingredients. Typically, there are four key ingredients\\nthat depict the functionality of a prompt for eliciting the\\nabilities of LLMs to complete the tasks, including task\\ndescription, input data, contextual information, and prompt\\nstyle. To have an intuitive understanding of our discussion,\\nwe also present three prompt examples for question answer-\\ning, meta-review generation, and text-to-SQL in Table 13.\\n• Task description.A task description is typically a specific\\ninstruction that LLMs are expected to follow. In general, one\\nshould clearly describe the task goal in natural language.\\nFor the tasks with special input or output format, detailed\\nclarifications are often needed, and one can further utilize\\nkeywords to highlight the special settings for better guiding\\nLLMs in task completion.\\n• Input data. In common cases, it is straightforward to\\ndescribe input data ( e.g., an instance to be responded by\\nLLMs) in natural language. For special input data, such\\nas knowledge graph and table, it is necessary to apply an\\nappropriate and convenient way to make them readable\\nfor LLMs. For structured data, linearization is commonly\\nused to transform the original records ( e.g., knowledge\\ntriples) into sequences [458] due to the simplicity. Further,\\nthe programming language ( e.g., executable code) has also\\nbeen utilized to formulate the structured data, which can\\nalso support using external tools ( e.g., program executor) to\\nproduce the precise results [459, 460].\\n• Contextual information. In addition to the task descrip-\\ntion and input data, contextual or background information'),\n",

For example, retrieved\\ndocuments are highly useful for open-domain question\\nanswering as supporting evidence. Both the quality of the\\nretrieved documents and their relevance to the question\\nhave an impact on the generated answers [461]. Thus, it\\nneeds to include such information in a proper prompt\\npattern or expression format. Furthermore, in-context task\\nexemplars are also helpful for eliciting LLMs to accomplish\\na complex task, which can better depict the task goal, the\\nspecial output formats, and the mapping relation between\\ninput and output.\\n• Prompt style. For different LLMs, it is important to\\ndesign a suitable prompt style for eliciting their abilities to\\nsolve specific tasks. Overall, one should express the prompt\\nas a clear question or detailed instruction that can be well\\nunderstood and answered. In some cases, it is also useful to\\nadd the prefix or suffix to better guide LLMs. For example,\\nusing the prefix “ Let us think step by step ” can help elicit\\nLLMs perform step-by-step reasoning, and using the prefix\\n“You are an expert on this task (or in this domain) ” can boost\\nthe performance of LLMs in some specific tasks. Further, for\\nchat-based LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT), instead of directly feeding\\na long or complex task prompt, it is suggested to decompose\\nit into multiple prompts for the sub-tasks and then feed\\nthem into LLMs via a multi-turn conversation [448].\\nDesign Principles. Based on the key ingredients of prompts,\\nwe summarize several critical design principles that can\\nhelp create more effective prompts for solving various tasks.\\n• Expressing the task goal clearly. Task descriptions should\\nnot be ambiguous or unclear, which likely lead to in-\\naccurate or inappropriate responses. This highlights the\\nneed for clear and unambiguous directives when utilizing\\nthese models [66]. A clear and detailed description should\\ncontain various elements to explain a task, including task\\nobjective, input/output data ( e.g., “Given a long document, I\\nwant you to generate a concise summary. ”), and the response\\nconstraints (e.g., “the length of the summary cannot exceed 50.”).\\nBy providing a well-clarified task description, LLMs can\\nmore effectively understand the target task and generate the\\ndesired output.\\n• Decomposing into easy, detailed sub-tasks. To solve com-\\nplex tasks, it is important to decompose the difficult task\\ninto several more easier, detailed sub-tasks for helping\\nLLMs accomplish the goal step by step, which is closely re-\\nlated to the planning technique in Section 6.4. For example,\\nfollowing the suggestion [454], we can explicitly list the sub-\\ntasks in the form of multiple numbered items ( e.g., “Braid a\\ncoherent narrative by performing the following tasks: 1. ...; 2. ...; 3.\\n...”). By decomposing a target task into sub-tasks, LLMs can\\nfocus on solving easier sub-tasks and finally achieve more\\naccurate results for complex tasks.\\n• Providing few-shot demonstrations. As discussed in Sec-\\ntion 6.2, LLMs can benefit from in-context learning for\\nsolving complex tasks, where the prompts contain a small\\nnumber of task examples of the desired input-output pairs,\\ni.e., few-shot demonstrations. Few-shot demonstrations can\\nhelp LLMs learn the semantic mapping between input and\\noutput without parameter tuning. In practice, it is suggested\\nthat one should generate a few high-quality demonstrations\\nfor the target task, which would highly benefit the final task\\nperformance.\\n• Utilizing model-friendly format. Since LLMs are pre-\\ntrained on specially constructed datasets, there are some\\nprompt formats that can make LLMs better understand\\nthe instruction. For example, as the OpenAI documentation\\nsuggests, we can use ### or \"\"\" as a stop symbol to\\nseparate the instruction and context, which can be better\\nunderstood by LLMs. As a general guideline, most existing\\nLLMs perform a task better in English, thus it is useful to\\nemploy English instructions to solve difficult tasks based on\\nmachine translation.\\nUseful Tips. In addition to the design principles, we also\\npresent a collection of useful prompt tips based on existing\\nwork or our empirical experiences in Table 12. Note that\\nthese tips are suggested in a general manner, it does not\\nindicate that they are the best prompts for the corresponding\\ntasks. This part will be continuously updated with more\\nguidelines or tips. We welcome readers to contribute to this\\ncollection of prompt tips. We present the detailed procedure\\nto contribute to the prompt tips, at the link: https://github.\\ncom/RUCAIBox/LLMSurvey/tree/main/Prompts.\\nEmpirical Analysis. We further conduct empirical studies\\nto present the impact of prompts on task performance. To\\nconduct the experiments, we select a variety of tasks that\\nspan language generation, knowledge utilization, complex\\nreasoning, structure data generation, and information re-\\ntrieval. For each task, we manually write a prompt that\\nfollows general guidelines introduced above. Note that the\\ntested prompts may not be the optimal for these tasks,\\nsince they mainly aim to help readers understand how to\\nwrite an effective prompt for solving different tasks. Also,\\nwe add a simplified prompt as the comparison for most\\ntasks. Following the experimental settings in Section 7.4, we\\nexamine the 3-shot performance of ChatGPT on complex\\nreasoning tasks (Colored Objects and GSM8k), and zero-\\nshot performance on other tasks. We report the experimental\\nresults in Table 17, where we also include the supervised\\nperformance in existing papers as reference.\\n• Carefully designed prompts can boost the zero-shot or few-\\nshot performance of ChatGPT. By comparing the results of\\nusing different prompts on the same task, we can see that\\nusing the carefully designed prompts can achieve better per-\\nformance than the simpler ones. In the carefully designed\\nprompts, we provide a more clearly expressed task de-\\nscription (e.g., WMT and WikiFact), or use a model-friendly\\nformat (e.g., GSM8k and OBQA). For example, for WikiFact\\ntask, the prompt with a more detailed task description leads\\nto a performance increase from 29.25 to 31.21.\\n• More complex tasks can benefit more from careful prompt\\nengineering on ChatGPT.

We abbreviate\\nprinciples as Prin. and list the IDs of the related principles for each prompt. 1⃝: expressing the task goal clearly; 2⃝:\\ndecomposing into easy, detailed sub-tasks; 3⃝: providing few-shot demonstrations; 4⃝: utilizing model-friendly format.\\nIngredient Collected Prompts Prin.\\nTask Description\\nT1. Make your prompt as detailed as possible , e.g., “Summarize the article into a short paragraph within 50 words. The major\\nstoryline and conclusion should be included, and the unimportant details can be omitted. ”\\n1⃝\\nT2. It is helpful to let the LLM know that it is an expert with a prefixed prompt , e.g., “You are a sophisticated expert in the\\ndomain of compute science.”\\n1⃝\\nT3. Tell the model more what it should do , but not what it should not do. 1⃝\\nT4. To avoid the LLM to generate too long output, you can just use the prompt: “ Question: Short Answer: ”. Besides, you can\\nalso use the following suffixes, “ in a or a few words ”, “in one of two sentences”.\\n1⃝\\nInput Data I1. For the question required factual knowledge, it is useful to first retrieve relevant documents via the search engine, and\\nthen concatenate them into the prompt as reference.\\n4⃝\\nI2. To highlight some important parts in your prompt, please use special marks, e.g., quotation (””) and line break (\\\\n). You\\ncan also use both of them for emphasizing.\\n4⃝\\nContextual Information\\nC1. For complex tasks, you can clearly describe the required intermediate steps to accomplish it, e.g., “Please answer the\\nquestion step by step as: Step 1 - Decompose the question into several sub-questions, · · ·”\\n2⃝\\nC2. If you want LLMs to provide the score for a text, it is necessary to provide a detailed description about the\\nscoring standard with examples as reference.\\n1⃝\\nC3. When LLMs generate text according to some context ( e.g., making recommendations according to purchase history),\\ninstructing them with the explanation about the generated result conditioned on context is helpful to improve the quality\\nof the generated text.\\n2⃝\\nC4. An approach similar to tree-of-thoughts but can be done in one prompt : e.g., Imagine three different experts are answering\\nthis question. All experts will write down one step of their thinking, then share it with the group of experts. Then all experts will go on\\nto the next step, etc. If any expert realizes they’re wrong at any point then they leave. The question is\\n2⃝\\nDemonstration\\nD1. Well-formatted in-context exemplars are very useful, especially for producing the outputs with complex formats. 3⃝\\nD2. For few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, you can also use the prompt “ Let’s think step-by-step ”, and the few-shot\\nexamples should be separated by “\\\\n” instead of full stop.\\n1⃝ 3⃝\\nD3. You can also retrieve similar examples in context to supply the useful task-specific knowledge for LLMs. To retrieve\\nmore relevant examples, it is useful to first obtain the answer of the question, and then concatenate it with the question for\\nretrieval.\\n3⃝ 4⃝\\nD4. The diversity of the in-context exemplars within the prompt is also useful. If it is not easy to obtain diverse questions,\\nyou can also seek to keep the diversity of the solutions for the questions.\\n3⃝\\nD5. When using chat-based LLMs, you can decompose in-context exemplars into multi-turn messages , to better match the\\nhuman-chatbot conversation format. Similarly, you can also decompose the reasoning process of an exemplars into multi-turn\\nconversation.\\n3⃝\\nD6. Complex and informative in-context exemplars can help LLMs answer complex questions. 3⃝\\nD7. As a symbol sequence can typically be divided into multiple segments (e.g., i1, i2, i3 − →i1, i2 and i2, i3), the preceding\\nones can be used as in-context exemplars to guide LLMs to predict the subsequent ones, meanwhile providing historical\\ninformation.\\n2⃝ 3⃝\\nD8. Order matters for in-context exemplars and prompts components. For very long input data, the position of the question\\n(first or last) may also affect the performance.\\n3⃝\\nD9. If you can not obtain the in-context exemplars from existing datasets, an alternative way is to use the zero-shot\\ngenerated ones from the LLM itself.\\n3⃝\\nOther Designs\\nO1. Let the LLM check its outputs before draw the conclusion, e.g., “Check whether the above solution is correct or not. ” 2⃝\\nO2. If the LLM can not well solve the task, you can seek help from external tools by prompting the LLM to manipulate\\nthem. In this way, the tools should be encapsulated into callable APIs with detailed description about their functions, to\\nbetter guide the LLM to utilize the tools.\\n4⃝\\nO3. The prompt should be self-contained, and better not include pronouns ( e.g., it and they) in the context. 1⃝\\nO4. When using LLMs for comparing two or more examples, the order affects the performance a lot. 1⃝\\nO5. Before the prompt, assigning a role for the LLM is useful to help it better fulfill the following task instruction, e.g., “I\\nwant you to act as a lawyer” .\\n1⃝\\nO6. OpenAI models can perform a task better in English than other languages. Thus, it is useful to first\\ntranslate the input into English and then feed it to LLMs.\\n4⃝\\nO7. For multi-choice questions, it is useful toconstrain the output space of the LLM. You can use a more detailed explanation\\nor just imposing constraints on the logits.\\n1⃝\\nO8. For sorting based tasks (e.g., recommendation), instead of directly outputting the complete text of each item after sorting,\\none can assign indicators (e.g., ABCD) to the unsorted items and instruct the LLMs to directly output the sorted indicators.\\n1⃝\\n• For mathematical reasoning tasks, it is more effective to\\ndesign specific prompts based on the format of programming\\nlanguage. For GSM8k, the designed prompt employs code-\\nformatted few-shot demonstrations to convert this mathe-\\nmatical reasoning task into code generation task, which can\\nleverage the strong code synthesis ability of ChatGPT for\\nsolving mathematical problems. Further, with the help of an\\nexternal program executor, we are able to obtain more pre-\\ncise results instead of using LLMs for arithmetic operation.\\nAs we can see, the performance is boosted from 78.47 to\\n79.30 on GSM8k, indicating the usefulness of programming\\nlanguage in mathematical reasoning tasks.\\n• In knowledge utilization and complex reasoning tasks,\\nChatGPT with proper prompts achieves comparable performance\\nor even outperforms the supervised baselines methods. In knowl-\\nedge utilization and complex reasoning tasks, ChatGPT\\nwith proper zero-shot or few-shot prompts can achieve\\ncomparable performance or even outperform the super-\\nvised methods, e.g., 31.21 (ChatGPT) v.s. 34.20 (supervised\\nbaseline) on WikiFact. Despite that, ChatGPT still performs\\nworse than supervised baseline models on some specific\\ntasks (e.g., ARC and WikiFact), since these supervised mod-'),\n",

With the help of specific\\nprompts, ChatGPT can also accomplish non-traditional NLP\\ntasks, i.e., the general recommendation and conversational\\nrecommendation. A key point is that these tasks can be\\nwell expressed or described in natural language. However,\\nthe performance of ChatGPT is still far from the referenced\\nperformance in these tasks, as LLMs cannot directly fit these\\ntasks, which require specific domain knowledge and task\\nadaptation [357, 462].\\n6.1.2 Prompt Optimization\\nAlthough manually creating task prompts is more intuitive,\\nit is time consuming and, more importantly, models are\\nhighly sensitive to the crafted prompts—improper prompts\\nwill lead to low task performance (as shown in Table 17).\\nTherefore, a large body of studies propose automatic opti-\\nmization approaches for discrete prompts and continuous\\nprompts to achieve the optimal performance [396, 405]. In\\nthis part, we will detail these studies from two perspectives,\\ni.e., discrete prompts and continuous prompts.\\nDiscrete Prompt Optimization. Discrete prompt is typically\\ncomposed of a sequence of natural language tokens. Despite\\nthat the form is simple and flexible, optimizing prompts in\\ndiscrete space is a challenging problem due to the combina-\\ntorial huge search space. To automatically search effective\\nprompts for downstream tasks, existing studies propose a\\nwide spectrum of discrete prompt approaches, which are\\ndetailed as follows.\\n• Gradient-based approaches. This kind of approaches\\naims to optimize the prompt search process by maximizing\\nthe output likelihood via gradient update [405, 464–466].\\nAs a representative work, Auto-Prompt [405] proposes a\\ngradient-guided method to greedily searches the optimal\\ntoken for each position of the prompt, leveraging the gra-\\ndient approximated by the change in the log-likelihood\\nwhen replacing a prompt token with another candidate\\ntoken from vocabulary. However, such a search process\\ncan be extremely expensive since it needs to evaluate each\\ncandidate token for each position of the prompt, leading to a\\nnumber of additional forward passes. Therefore, improved\\ngradient method [464] has been proposed by transforming\\ndiscrete tokens into continuous embeddings and computing\\nthe gradient on continuous space during optimization.\\n• RL-based approaches. Since discrete prompts are difficult\\nto be learned through gradient back-propagation, a num-\\nber of studies propose to formulate the discrete prompt\\noptimization as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem and\\nleverage RL algorithms for optimization [467, 468]. For ex-\\nample, RLPrompt [467] trains a policy network to generate\\ndesired prompts with multiple reward functions. In this\\napproach, several effective reward stabilization strategies\\nare also proposed to enhance the RL training efficiency.\\nCompared to previous work that requires sufficient data\\nfor training, TEMPERA [468] proposes to directly generate\\nprompts at test time by utilizing a pre-trained RL agent\\nto sequentially edit different parts of an manually-written\\ninitial prompt.\\n• Edit-based approaches. For the above methods, gradient-\\nbased and RL-based tuning can be extremely computation-\\nally demanding for ever larger models, and may not be fea-\\nsible for API-based model calls ( e.g., ChatGPT). Therefore,\\nanother line of work aims to directly edit existing prompts\\nbased on the task performance. Specifically, GPS [469] bor-\\nrows an idea from the genetic algorithm and proposes\\na genetic prompt search method that utilizes a language\\nmodel (i.e., T5) to edit prompts by taking the cloze task form.\\nIn addition to model based edit methods, human-defined\\noperations can be also employed for prompt editing [470],\\nincluding delete, swap, paraphrase, and addition. Based\\non these operations, they iteratively edit the prompts and\\ngreedily search for the best prompt guided by the model\\nperformance on a small pool of examples.\\n• LLM-based approaches. Due to the exceptional capacities\\nof LLMs, an increasing number of studies directly leverage\\nLLMs as prompt generator [471–473]. Specifically, APE [471]\\nutilizes an LLM to generate initial prompts, then selects\\nthe best prompt with the highest accuracy, and finally im-\\nproves the best candidate through an iterative Monte Carlo\\nsearch method. Similarly, APO [472] instructs the LLM to\\ngenerate text feedback on how to refine an old prompt\\ninto new improved prompts. However, their search in the\\nprompt space might be inefficient without fully considering\\nthe whole refinement trace of previous prompts, thus po-\\ntentially leading to sub-optimal results. Therefore, another\\nstudy [473] incorporates the previous prompts with their\\nscores to instruct LLMs for progressively generating better\\nnew prompts. However, these approaches still struggle in\\nexploring the vast space of effective prompts. Inspired by\\nhuman-like trial-and-error, prompt optimization is further\\nformulated as a strategic planning problem [474] and uses\\nMonte Carlo tree search to navigate the vast prompt space.\\nContinuous Prompt Optimization. Different from discrete\\nprompts, continuous prompts consist of a set of continuous\\nembeddings, which can be directly optimized through the\\ngradient update based on the loss of downstream tasks.\\nNote that continuous prompt optimization has been mainly\\nstudied in PLMs, but draws limited attention in era of LLMs\\ndue to their massive magnitudes of parameters. We include\\nthe discussion of this part for content completeness. In prior\\nwork, most studies typically rely on supervised learning to\\ntrain continuous prompts based on task data. Furthermore,\\nin data-scarce scenarios, transfer learning methods can be\\nemployed to alleviate the lack of labeled data on target tasks.\\nThese two approaches are detailed below.\\n• Prompt learning with sufficient data. In this approach,\\nmost existing methods regard continuous prompts as train-\\nable model parameters and then leverage supervised learn-\\ning to optimize the continuous prompts by minimizing\\nthe cross-entropy loss based on sufficient downstream task\\ndata [396, 397, 401, 475]. As discussed in Section 5.3.1,\\nprefix tuning [396] prepends a sequence of prefixes ( i.e.,\\na set of trainable continuous vectors) to each Transformer\\nlayer in language models, while prompt tuning [397] only\\nincorporates trainable prompt vectors at the input layer. By\\nfixing the large-scale parameters of LLMs and only tuning\\ncontinuous prompt vector, this kind of approaches can be\\nextremely parameter-efficient (Section 5.3). However, these'),\n",

Figure 14 presents an illustra-\\ntion of ICL. First, starting with a task description, a few ex-\\namples are selected from the task dataset as demonstrations.\\nThen, they are combined in a specific order to form nat-\\nural language prompts with specially designed templates.\\nFinally, the test instance is appended to the demonstration\\nas the input for LLMs to generate the output. Based on task\\ndemonstrations, LLMs can recognize and perform a new\\ntask without explicit gradient update.\\nFormally, let Dk = {f(x1, y1), . . . , f(xk, yk)} represent\\na set of demonstrations with k examples, where f(xk, yk) is\\nthe prompt function that transforms the k-th task example\\ninto natural language prompts. Given the task description\\nI, demonstration Dk, and a new input query xk+1, the\\nprediction of the output ˆyk+1 generated from LLMs can be\\nformulated as follows40:\\nLLM\\n\\x00\\nI, f(x1, y1), . . . , f(xk, yk)| {z }\\ndemonstrations\\n, f(xk+1|{z}\\ninput\\n, |{z}\\nanswer\\n)\\n\\x01\\n→ ˆyk+1.\\n(12)\\nwhere the actual answer yk+1 is left as a blank to be\\npredicted by the LLM. Since the performance of ICL heavily\\nrelies on demonstrations, it is important to properly design\\nthem in the prompts. According to the construction process\\nin Equation (12), we focus on three major aspects of for-\\nmatting demonstrations in the prompts, including how to\\nselect examples that make up demonstrations, format each\\nexample into the prompt with the functionf(·), and arrange\\ndemonstrations in a reasonable order.\\nA comprehensive review of ICL has been presented in\\nthe survey paper [50], and we suggest the readers refer-\\nring to it for a more general, detailed discussion on this\\ntopic. Compared with this survey, we specially focus on the\\ndiscussion of applying ICL to LLMs in two major aspects,\\ni.e., demonstration design and the underlying mechanism\\nof ICL. Also, ICL has a close connection with instruction\\ntuning (discussed in Section 5.1) in that both utilize nat-\\nural language to format the task or instances. However,\\ninstruction tuning needs to fine-tune LLMs for adaptation,\\nwhile ICL only prompts LLMs for utilization. Furthermore,\\ninstruction tuning can enhance the ICL ability of LLMs to\\nperform target tasks, especially in the zero-shot setting (only\\nusing task descriptions) [69].\\n6.2.2 Demonstration Design\\nSeveral studies have shown that the effectiveness of ICL\\nis highly affected by the design of demonstrations [432,\\n40. When ICL was introduced in the GPT-3’s paper [55], it was\\noriginally defined to be a combination of the task description and\\ndemonstration examples, wherein either component is dispensable.\\nFollowing this definition, when a LLM is required to solve an unseen\\ntask by using only task descriptions, it can be also considered to\\nperform ICL for task solving, whereas the ICL ability can be enhanced\\nby instruction tuning.\\n478, 479] Following the discussion in Section 6.2.1, we will\\nintroduce the demonstration design of ICL from three major\\naspects, i.e., demonstration selection, format, and order.\\nDemonstration Selection. The performance of ICL tends\\nto have a large variance with different demonstration exam-\\nples [428], so it is important to select a subset of examples\\nthat can effectively leverage the ICL capability of LLMs.\\nThere are two main demonstration selection approaches,\\nnamely heuristic and LLM-based approaches:\\n• Heuristic approaches. Due to their simplicity and low\\ncosts, existing work widely adopts heuristic methods to\\nselect demonstrations. Several studies employ ak-NN based\\nretriever to select examples that are semantically relevant to\\nthe query [428, 480]. However, they perform the selection\\nindividually for each example, rather than evaluating the\\nexample set as a whole. To resolve this issue, diversity-\\nbased selection strategies are proposed to choose the most\\nrepresentative set of examples for specific tasks [481, 482].\\nFurthermore, in [483], both relevance and diversity are taken\\ninto consideration when selecting demonstrations.\\n• LLM-based approaches. Another line of work selects\\ndemonstrations by making use of LLMs. For example, LLMs\\ncan be utilized to directly measure the informativeness\\nof each example according to the performance gain after\\nadding the example [484]. In addition, EPR [429] proposes\\na two-stage retrieval approach that first recalls similar ex-\\namples with an unsupervised method ( e.g., BM25) and then\\nranks them using a dense retriever (trained with positive\\nand negative examples labeled by LLMs). As an alterna-\\ntive approach, the task of demonstration selection can be\\nformulated into a RL problem, where LLMs serve as the\\nreward function to provide feedback for training the policy\\nmodel [485]. Since LLMs perform well for text annota-\\ntion [486], some recent studies employ LLM itself as the\\ndemonstration generator without human intervention [487].\\nTo summarize, as discussed in [488], the selected demon-\\nstration examples in ICL should contain sufficient informa-\\ntion about the task to solve as well as be relevant to the test\\nquery, for the above two selection approaches.\\nDemonstration Format. After selecting task examples, the\\nnext step is to integrate and format them into a natural\\nlanguage prompt for LLMs. A straightforward method is to\\ninstantiate a pre-defined template with the corresponding\\ninput-output pairs [36]. To construct more informative tem-\\nplates, recent studies consider adding task descriptions [69]\\nor enhancing the reasoning capability of LLMs with chain-\\nof-thought prompts [33]. For instance, in [166], the authors\\ncollect a large-scale dataset with task descriptions written by\\nhumans. After tuning with this dataset, the performance on\\nseen tasks can be boosted, and LLMs can also generalize to\\nunseen tasks to some extent. To reduce the annotation costs,\\na semi-automated approach has been proposed in [143]\\nby employing a seed set consisting of human-written task\\ndescriptions to guide LLMs to generate task descriptions\\nfor new tasks. Since it is costly to manually annotate\\ndemonstration formats for different tasks, some work also\\nstudies how to automatically generate high-quality ones.\\nAs two representative methods, Auto-CoT [434] leverages\\nLLMs with the zero-shot prompt “ Let’s think step by step ”\\nfor generating intermediate reasoning steps, while least-to-'),\n",

ICL prompts LLMs\\nwith a natural language description, several demonstrations, and a test query, while CoT prompting involves a series of\\nintermediate reasoning steps in prompts.\\nmost prompting [439] first queries LLMs to perform prob-\\nlem decomposition and then utilizes LLMs to sequentially\\nsolve sub-problems based on the intermediate answers to\\npreviously solved ones.\\nDemonstration Order. LLMs are shown to sometimes suffer\\nfrom the recency bias, i.e., they are prone to repeat answers\\nthat are near the end of demonstrations [479]. Thus, it is\\nimportant to arrange demonstrations ( i.e., task examples)\\nin a reasonable order. Early work proposes several heuris-\\ntic methods to quickly find a good order. For example,\\ndemonstrations can be directly organized according to their\\nsimilarity to the query in the embedding space [428]: the\\nmore similar, the closer to the end. In addition, global\\nand local entropy metrics can be used to score different\\ndemonstration orders [432]. To integrate more task infor-\\nmation, some recent studies propose to minimize the code\\nlength required to compress and transmit task labels, which\\nis inspired by information theory [489]. However, these\\nmethods need additional labeled data as the validation\\nset to evaluate the performance of specific demonstration\\norders. To eliminate this need, the authors in [432] propose\\nto sample the validation data from the LLM itself.\\n6.2.3 Underlying Mechanism\\nAfter pre-training, LLMs can exhibit intriguing ICL capabil-\\nity without being updated. In what follows, we discuss two\\nkey questions about the ICL ability of LLMs, i.e., “how does\\npre-training affect the ICL ability ” and “ how do LLMs perform\\nICL during inference”.\\nHow Pre-Training Affects ICL? ICL is first proposed in\\nGPT-3 [55], and it has been shown that the ICL ability\\nbecomes more significant with a larger model size. Further,\\nsome studies reveal that small-scale PLMs can also demon-\\nstrate a strong ICL ability by continual pre-training [490]\\nor fine-tuning [491] on specially designed training tasks,\\nwhich typically involve additional task examples in the\\ninput during the training process. It suggests that the design\\nof training tasks is an important influence factor on the ICL\\ncapability of LLMs. Besides training tasks, recent studies\\nhave also investigated the relationship between ICL and\\npre-training corpora [488, 492]. For example, ICL can be\\ntheoretically explained as the product of pre-training on\\ndocuments that exhibit long-range coherence [488]. Fur-\\nther, another study [492] theoretically analyzes that when\\nscaling parameters and data, LLMs based on next-word\\nprediction can emerge the ability of ICL by learning from\\nthe compositional structure ( e.g., how words and phrases\\nare combined to form larger linguistic units like sentences)\\npresent in language data.\\nHow LLMs Perform ICL?At the inference stage, researchers\\nfocus on analyzing how the ICL capability operates based\\non given demonstrations since no explicit learning or updat-\\ning is involved. According to the discussion in [493], there\\nare two main ways for LLMs to utilize demonstrations: task\\nrecognition and task learning.\\n• Task recognition. In the first way, LLMs recognize the\\ntask from demonstrations and utilize the prior knowledge\\nobtained from pre-training to solve new test tasks. A Proba-\\nbly Approximately Correct (PAC) framework [494] has been\\nproposed to assess the learnability of ICL. It assumes that\\nthere exists a latent variable representing the task in the pre-\\ntraining data, and LLMs have been shown to be capable\\nof capturing this variable from demonstrations, enabling\\nthem to recognize the task in ICL. Also, the interpretation\\nof ICL as task recognition is supported by several empir-\\nical studies [478, 495]. For example, it has been observed\\nthat replacing the inputs or labels of demonstrations with\\nrandom ones sampled from the input or label space does\\nnot seriously hurt the performance of LLMs, indicating that\\nLLMs mainly recognize the target task from demonstrations\\ninstead of learning from them [478, 493]. Similarly, LLMs\\ncan exhibit decent performance even if the prompt template\\nis irrelevant or misleading [495].'),\n",

In the second way, LLMs learn new tasks\\nunseen in the pre-training stage only through demonstra-\\ntions. Specially, task learning is analyzed mainly from the\\nperspective of gradient descent and considered as implicit\\nfine-tuning [65, 496]. Then, ICL can be explained as follows:\\nby means of forward computation, LLMs generate meta-\\ngradients with respect to demonstrations and implicitly per-\\nform gradient descent via the attention mechanism. Exper-\\niments also show that certain attention heads in LLMs are\\ncapable of performing task-agnostic atomic operations ( e.g.,\\ncopying and prefix matching), which are closely related to\\nthe ICL ability [497]. Furthermore, some studies abstract\\nICL as an algorithm learning process [498]. For example, the\\nauthors in [498] find that LLMs essentially encode implicit\\nmodels through their parameters during pre-training. With\\nthe examples provided in ICL, LLMs can implement learn-\\ning algorithms such as gradient descent or directly compute\\nthe closed-form solution to update these models during\\nforward computation. Under this explanation framework,\\nit has been shown that LLMs can effectively learn simple\\nlinear functions and even some complex functions like deci-\\nsion trees with ICL [498].\\nAs discussed in a recent study [493], LLMs exhibit the\\nabilities of both task recognition and task learning in ICL,\\nbut the two abilities seem to be possessed with different\\nmodel scales. As shown in the experiments [493], the ability\\nof task recognition is easier to obtain, and even a small LM\\nwith only 350M parameters can exhibit this ability, while\\ntask learning can only emerge for LLMs with at least 66B\\nparameters. Another study [499] also supports this find-\\ning with specially designed experiments. They set up the\\ntasks with flipped and semantically unrelated labels in the\\nexperiment, which require task learning when performing\\nICL. The results suggest that small LMs tend to disregard\\nthe labels and mainly depend on their prior knowledge\\nto accomplish the task, while LLMs have the ability to\\nsurpass their prior knowledge and acquire new knowledge\\nfrom demonstrations, resulting in better outcomes. Further-\\nmore, to improve the task learning ability, Meta-In-Context\\nLearning [500] proposes to include multiple related tasks\\ninstead of just a single one in the prompt. In addition,\\nSymbol Tuning [501] fine-tunes LLMs on demonstrations\\nwith semantically unrelated labels ( e.g., foo/bar instead of\\npositive/negative for sentiment analysis), forcing LLMs to\\nlearn the task from demonstrations instead of relying on\\nprior knowledge.\\n6.3 Chain-of-Thought Prompting\\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting [33, 502] is an improved\\nprompting strategy to boost the performance of LLMs on\\ncomplex reasoning tasks, such as arithmetic reasoning [503],\\ncommonsense reasoning [504], and symbolic reasoning [33].\\nInstead of simply constructing the prompts with input-\\noutput pairs like ICL, CoT prompting further incorporates\\nintermediate reasoning steps, which serve as the bridge be-\\ntween inputs and outputs. Figure 14 presents an illustration\\nof CoT. In the following part, we will first elaborate on the\\nbasic CoT prompting approach and its improved strategies,\\nthen discuss when and why CoT prompting works.\\n6.3.1 Basic CoT Prompting Approach\\nCoT prompting is first proposed as an extension of ICL [33],\\nwhich augments each demonstration ⟨input, output ⟩ as\\n⟨input, CoT, output ⟩. A CoT is a series of intermediate\\nreasoning steps for connecting the input and output. With\\nthese augmented demonstrations, LLMs can follow them to\\ngenerate CoTs and the answer for a new input. However,\\nunlike ⟨input, output ⟩ pairs in ICL, CoTs are difficult to\\nobtain and usually require human annotation. Fortunately,\\nit has been found that LLMs can be triggered to generate\\nCoTs through simple instructions like “ Let’s think step by\\nstep.” [505], making CoT prompting easy to use. There are\\nalso alternative magic prompts that can elicit the ability\\nof CoT reasoning and further improve the performance of\\nLLMs, such as “ Take a deep breath and work on this problem\\nstep-by-step.” [473].\\nAs illustrated in Figure 15, the generation process of\\nCoT follows a chain structure in the basic CoT prompt-\\ning approach, where LLMs generate CoTs step by step.\\nTypically, CoT takes the format of natural language text.\\nHowever, textual CoTs may not work well on complex tasks\\nthat require rigorous logic for reasoning. Considering this,\\nsome work uses code [506, 507] due to its structured and\\nprecise nature. Furthermore, the authors in [508] propose\\nto dynamically select text or code as the format of CoTs to\\ncombine their advantages.\\n6.3.2 Improved CoT Prompting Strategies\\nDespite the performance improvement in complex reason-\\ning tasks, CoT prompting still suffers from problems like\\nincorrect reasoning and instability. In this part, we first\\nintroduce how to design better CoT prompts and enhanced\\nCoT generation strategies, and then introduce the extension\\nof the basic chain structure of CoT. Figure 15 illustrates the\\nevolution of representative CoT prompting strategies.\\nBetter Prompt Design. Since CoT prompting relies on\\nprompts to elicit the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, the\\ndesign of prompts is critical to its performance. As a di-\\nrect approach, it is shown that using diverse CoTs ( i.e.,\\nmultiple reasoning paths for each problem) can effectively\\nenhance the performance [437]. Another intuitive idea is\\nthat prompts with more complex reasoning paths are more\\nlikely to elicit the reasoning ability of LLMs [433], which\\ncan result in higher accuracy in generating correct an-\\nswers. However, all these approaches rely on annotated CoT\\ndatasets, which limits their use in practice. To overcome\\nthis limitation, magic instructions such as “ Let’s think step\\nby step ” can be used to automatically construct CoTs by\\nprompting LLMs [434].\\nEnhanced CoT Generation. Since LLMs are prone to\\nproducing incorrect reasoning steps and exhibiting insta-\\nbility in the generation process, there are a number of\\nstudies [436, 509] to improve the generation of CoT. In this\\npart, we will introduce two typical approaches to enhancing\\nthe generation of CoT: sampling- and verification-based\\nmethods.\\n• Sampling-based methods. LLMs are known to suffer\\nfrom instability during inference, which can lead to un-\\nfaithfulness in the generated reasoning steps. To address'),\n",

It begins with the basic CoT approach and progresses\\nto enhanced CoT generation techniques, including sampling-based and verification-based methods. Finally, it extends to\\nvariations of the chain structure, such as trees and graphs. Here, “thought” refers to an intermediate reasoning step as\\nstated in [33, 451].\\nthis issue, some work proposes to sample multiple rea-\\nsoning paths instead of using greedy decoding. As a rep-\\nresentative solution, self-consistency [436] first generates\\nseveral reasoning paths and then takes an ensemble over\\nthe corresponding answers, selecting the most consistent\\none through majority voting. However, such a method can\\nstill lead to wrong answers when most of the reasoning\\npaths are misled. Considering this, the authors in [433] only\\nvote on the k most complex reasoning paths based on their\\nobservation that reasoning paths with higher complexity\\n(e.g., more reasoning steps) usually have better performance.\\nFurthermore, MCR [510] proposes referring to the steps\\nfrom other reasoning paths when generating the next step,\\nand performs reasoning across multiple reasoning paths to\\ngenerate the final answer.\\n• Verification-based methods. The sequential nature of rea-\\nsoning steps in CoTs can lead to the accumulation of errors\\nin the generated CoTs when certain steps are incorrect. To\\nmitigate this problem, recent studies propose to verify the\\ncorrectness of generated reasoning steps with either trained\\nverifiers or LLMs themselves. For example, DIVERSE [509]\\ntrains solution-level and step-level verifiers respectively to\\nexamine the reasoning steps at different granularities. An-\\nother approach [511] utilizes LLMs to verify the correctness\\nof reasoning steps through step-by-step self-verification\\nwith a specially designed reasoning format. In addition,\\nseveral studies propose backward reasoning for verification:\\nit first deduces the necessary question conditions [512, 513]\\nor variables [514] from the model’s predictions, and then\\ncompares them with the original ones.\\nReasoning Structure Extension. Despite the generality, the\\nchain reasoning structure of basic CoT prompting limits its\\neffectiveness in solving complex tasks, which require ex-\\nploration like foresight and backtracking during inference.\\nTherefore, many studies have been devoted to extending\\nthe reasoning structure by designing more intricate thought\\nprocesses, e.g., tree- and graph-structured reasoning.\\n• Tree-structured reasoning.This approach (exemplified by\\nTree of Thoughts (ToT) [451, 515]) formulates the reasoning\\nprocess in a hierarchical tree structure, where intermediate\\nthoughts are nodes. In this way, it enables LLMs to explore\\nmultiple reasoning paths in parallel and further supports\\nthe operation of lookahead and backtracking to facilitate\\nmore comprehensive decisions. In addition, TouT [516] takes\\nthe uncertainty of intermediate thoughts into account for\\nthought evaluation based on Monte Carlo Dropout.\\n• Graph-structured reasoning. Although the tree structure\\nfacilitates parallel reasoning, it also imposes restrictions on\\nthe reasoning process. With more complex topological struc-\\ntures, graphs offer greater flexibility in reasoning, enabling\\nthe characterization of more intricate relationships and in-\\nteractions. For instance, Graph of Thoughts (GoT) [517, 518]\\nconceptualizes the reasoning process as an arbitrary graph,\\nwhere vertices denote intermediate thoughts and edges\\ndenote the interdependence between these thoughts. Com-\\npared with ToT, it can further utilize thoughts from other\\nreasoning paths when generating new thoughts. However,\\nsuch an approach requires a large number of interactions\\nwith LLMs, making the thought exploration process highly\\ninefficient. To reduce potentially meaningless thought\\nexploration, XoT [519] further proposes to guide the search\\nof thoughts with pre-trained policy and value networks.\\n6.3.3 Further Discussion on CoT Prompting\\nIn this part, we present discussions regarding two funda-\\nmental questions related to CoT prompting, i.e., “when does\\nCoT prompting work for LLMs ” and “ why can LLMs perform\\nCoT reasoning”.\\nWhen CoT Prompting Works For LLMs? Since CoT reason-\\ning is an emergent ability [31], it only has a positive effect\\non sufficiently large models (typically containing 10B or\\nmore parameters [33]) but not on small models.

Whereas, for other tasks that do not rely\\non complex reasoning, CoT prompting might lead to worse\\nperformance than standard prompting [438], e.g., MNLI-\\nm/mm, SST-2, and QQP from GLUE [260]. Interestingly, it\\nseems that the performance gain brought by CoT prompting\\ncould be significant only when standard prompting yields\\npoor results [33].\\nWhy LLMs Can Perform CoT Reasoning? As the second\\nquestion, we discuss the underlying mechanism of CoT\\nprompting in the following two aspects.\\n• The source of CoT reasoning ability. Regarding the source\\nof CoT reasoning capability, it is widely hypothesized that it\\ncan be attributed to training on code since models trained on\\nit show a strong reasoning ability [47, 520, 521]. Intuitively,\\ncode data is well organized with algorithmic logic and\\nprogramming flow, which may be useful to improve the rea-\\nsoning performance of LLMs. However, this hypothesis still\\nlacks publicly reported evidence of ablation experiments\\n(with and without training on code). In addition, instruction\\ntuning seems not to be the key reason for obtaining the CoT\\nreasoning ability, since it has been empirically shown that\\ninstruction tuning on non-CoT data does not improve the\\nperformance on held-out CoT reasoning benchmarks [69].\\n• The effect of CoT prompting components . The major dis-\\ntinction between CoT prompting and standard prompting\\nis the incorporation of reasoning paths prior to the final\\nanswer. Thus, some researchers investigate the effects of\\ndifferent components in the reasoning paths. Specifically,\\na recent study identifies three key components in CoT\\nprompting, namely symbols (e.g., numerical quantities in\\narithmetic reasoning), patterns (e.g., equations in arithmetic\\nreasoning), and text (i.e., the rest of tokens that are not\\nsymbols or patterns) [522]. It is shown that the latter two\\nparts ( i.e., patterns and text) are essential to the model\\nperformance, and removing either one would lead to a\\nsignificant performance drop. However, the correctness of\\nsymbols and patterns does not seem critical. Further, there\\nexists a symbiotic relationship between text and patterns:\\nthe text helps LLMs to generate useful patterns, and patterns\\naid LLMs to understand tasks and generate texts that help\\nsolve them [522].\\nIn summary, CoT prompting provides a general and\\nflexible approach to eliciting the reasoning ability of LLMs.\\nThere are also some preliminary attempts to extend this\\ntechnique to solve multimodal [523] and multilingual\\ntasks [524].\\n6.4 Planning for Complex Task Solving\\nPrompting with ICL and CoT is a conceptually simple yet\\ngeneral approach to solving various tasks. However, this\\napproach struggles with complex tasks like mathematical\\nreasoning [525] and multi-hop question answering [526]. As\\nan enhanced approach, prompt-based planning has been\\nproposed to break down complex tasks into smaller sub-\\ntasks and generate a plan of actions to accomplish the task.\\nPlan ExecutorTask Planner\\n(LLM)\\nEnvironment\\nTask Result\\nPlan\\n(generate & refine)\\nFeedback Action\\nInternal External\\nLLM World\\n…\\nOthers\\nPlanning\\nFramework\\nMemory Tool\\nHuman\\nFig. 16: An illustration of the formulation for prompt based\\nplanning by LLMs for solving complex tasks.\\n6.4.1 The Overall Framework\\nIn this part, we first formulate the general planning\\nparadigm of LLMs for solving complex tasks, which is\\nillustrated in Figure 16.\\nIn this paradigm, there are typically three components:\\ntask planner , plan executor , and environment41. Specifically,\\ntask planner, which is played by LLMs, aims to generate the\\nwhole plan to solve a target task. The plan can be presented\\nin various forms, e.g., an action sequence in the form of\\nnatural language [439] or an executable program written in\\nprogramming language [443]. The LLM-based task planner\\ncan be enhanced with the memory mechanism for plan\\nstorage and retrieval, which is helpful for long-horizon\\ntasks. Then, plan executor is responsible for executing the\\nactions in the plan. It can be implemented by models like\\nLLMs for textual tasks [441] or by tools like code interpreters\\nfor coding tasks [450]. Furthermore, environment refers to\\nwhere the plan executor carries out the actions, which can\\nbe set differently according to specific tasks, e.g., the LLM\\nitself [527] or an external virtual world like Minecraft [528].\\nIt provides feedback about the execution result of the action to\\nthe task planner, either in the form of natural language [450]\\nor from other multimodal signals [446].\\nFor solving a complex task, the task planner first needs to\\nclearly understand the task goal and generate a reasonable\\nplan based on the reasoning of LLMs (See Section 6.4.2).\\nThen, the plan executor acts according to the plan in the\\nenvironment, and the environment will produce feedback\\nfor the task planner (See Section 6.4.3). The task planner\\ncan further incorporate the feedback obtained from the\\nenvironment to refine its initial plan and iteratively perform\\nthe above process to get better results as the task solution\\n(See Section 6.4.4).\\n41. Despite the similarity with RL, our formulation decouples the\\nplanning and execution phases, whereas in RL, they are typically\\ninterleaved in the agent. This paradigm is defined in a general yet\\nslightly loose way, and it mainly aims to help readers understand the\\nkey idea underlying the planning approaches of LLMs.'),\n",

It is straightforward for LLMs to\\ngenerate plans in the form of natural language. In this\\napproach, LLMs are prompted to generate a sequence of\\nactions for the plan executor to perform and solve the com-\\nplex task. For example, Plan-and-Solve [441] adds explicit\\ninstructions like “ devise a plan” to directly prompt\\nthe LLM for planning in a zero-shot manner, while Self-\\nplanning [529] and DECOMP [440] add demonstrations in\\nthe prompt to guide the LLM to devise a plan through ICL.\\nFollowing this way, some work further considers incorpo-\\nrating extra tools or models when planning. For example,\\nToolFormer [80] first annotates a pre-training corpus with\\npotential API calls using LLMs, and then fine-tunes LLMs\\non it, so that LLMs can learn when and how to call APIs\\nand incorporate the results returned by APIs during gener-\\nation. HuggingGPT [444] introduces the models available in\\nHuggingFace and regards LLMs as the controller to select\\nsuitable models based on their descriptions and aggregate\\ntheir results as the final solution.\\nCode-based Approaches. Although text-based approaches\\nsound intuitive, they cannot guarantee faithful execution of\\nthe plan, which may lead to failure even when the plan is\\nsound. To address this issue, code-based approaches have\\nbeen proposed to generate more verifiable plans in the\\nform of executable code in programming languages, e.g.,\\nPython or PDDL. In this way, LLMs are first prompted\\nto generate the program and then utilize a deterministic\\nsolver to execute it. For example, Faithful CoT [442] and\\nPAL [443] decompose a reasoning task into two stages: at\\nthe first stage, the LLM generates a plan conditioned on the\\nquery; at the second stage, a deterministic solver executes\\nthe plan to derive the final answer. Furthermore, code-based\\napproaches can be applied to embodied agents in a similar\\nway. For example, PROGPROMPT [530] and LLM+P [531]\\nfirst utilize LLMs to generate plans in the form of python\\nfunctions or PDDL files, and then leverage a virtual agent\\nor classical planner to solve the problem according to the\\ncode-based plans.\\n6.4.3 Feedback Acquisition\\nAfter executing the generated plan, the environment would\\nproduce the feedback signal to the LLM-based task planner,\\nwhich can be used to refine its initial plan for better results.\\nIn existing work, there are typically two sources of feedback\\nfrom the environment, depending on their relationship with\\nthe LLM-based task planner: internal ( i.e., the LLM itself)\\nand external (e.g., tools or virtual worlds) feedback.\\nInternal Feedback. The LLM itself can be utilized as a\\nfeedback provider. One straightforward way is to directly\\nevaluate the quality of the generated plans through prompt-\\ning. For example, RAP [447] evaluate the likelihood that\\neach candidate plan can lead to task success, while Tree of\\nThoughts [527] proposes to vote across plans by making\\ncomparisons between them. Further, LLMs can provide\\nfeedback based on the intermediate results from the plan\\nexecutor. For example, Reflexion [450] utilizes LLMs to\\ntransform sparse result signals ( e.g., success or failure) into\\nconcrete text-based feedback ( e.g., “You should recommend\\ncomedies that the user mentions in the query instead of horror\\nmovies”) and stores this feedback in long-term memory for\\nfuture planning.\\nExternal Feedback. In addition to LLMs, external objects\\ncan also provide feedback signals. For example, tools like\\ncode interpreters are widely used in programming tasks to\\nprovide real-time error messages [450], models like stable\\ndiffusion [532] can be used in multimodal tasks to provide\\nvisual perception [446], and virtual worlds like Minecraft\\ncan provide immersive experiences [528]. Besides, some\\nwork ( e.g., Generative Agents [533]) explores multi-agent\\ncollaboration in simulated environments, where each agent\\nreceives feedback not only from interaction with the envi-\\nronment but also from communication with other agents.\\n6.4.4 Plan Refinement\\nWith access to feedback from the environment, the task\\nplanner can accordingly refine its current plan and itera-\\ntively go through the “planning – execution – refinement” loop\\nfor better results. In this part, we summarizes three major\\nrefinement approaches in existing work.\\nReasoning. The feedback data from the environment may\\nnot be directly suitable to be utilized by LLMs for plan\\nrefinement, e.g., containing irrelevant information or taking\\na non-language form. To solve this, some work adds the\\nexplicit reasoning process to extract critical information\\nfrom feedback [448, 449]. For example, React [449] prompts\\nLLMs with demonstrations to generate reasoning traces\\nover feedback. It has been widely used in autonomous agent\\nprojects, such as AutoGPT [534], which can automatically\\nreason over the observed feedback to revise the initial\\nplan for solving various user requests. However, these ap-\\nproaches typically fix the order of reasoning and planning.\\nTo support flexible switching between the two processes for\\nbetter performance, ChatCoT [448] further unifies the tool-\\naugmented reasoning process into a multi-turn conversation\\nbetween the LLM-based task planner and the tool-based\\nenvironment.\\nBacktracking. Early methods mainly consider planning\\nforward actions while maintaining the existing plan, thus\\nlikely leading to local optimal plans based on a short-term\\nevaluation. To solve this, Tree of Thoughts [527] allows back-\\ntracking with search algorithms like breadth-first and depth-\\nfirst search to make global planning. It refines the plan\\nstep by step by backtracking to the last state in the initial\\nplan and choosing the next unexplored action. Furthermore,\\nsome studies [446, 535] utilize feedback signals to revise the\\nentire plan. For example, DEPS [535] selects a better plan\\naccording to feedback signals, while TIP [446] adds feedback\\nsignals to prompts for the LLM-based planner to revise each\\nstep in the initial plan.\\nMemorization. In order to handle long-horizon tasks, it has\\nbecome a key approach to aid plan refinement with long-\\nterm memory in addition to utilizing the short-term memory of'),\n",

In this\\nsection, we first introduce three types of basic ability evalu-\\nation of LLMs for language generation and understanding,\\nthen present several advanced ability evaluations with more\\ncomplicated settings or goals, and finally discuss existing\\nbenchmarks, evaluation approaches, and empirical analysis.\\n7.1 Basic Ability\\nIn this part, we mainly focus on three basic types of ability\\nevaluation for LLMs, i.e., language generation, knowledge\\nutilization, and complex reasoning. It is noted that we do not\\nintend to have complete coverage of all the related tasks, but\\ninstead only focus on the most widely discussed or studied\\ntasks for LLMs. Next, we introduce these tasks in detail.\\n7.1.1 Language Generation\\nAccording to the task definition, existing tasks about lan-\\nguage generation can be roughly categorized into language\\nmodeling, conditional text generation, and code synthesis\\ntasks. Note that code synthesis is not a typical NLP task, we\\ninclude it for discussion because it can be directly solved\\nby a number of LLMs (trained on code data) in a similar\\ngeneration approach as natural language text.\\nLanguage Modeling. As the most fundamental ability of\\nLLMs, language modeling aims to predict the next token\\nbased on the previous tokens [1], which mainly focuses\\non the capacity of basic language understanding and gen-\\neration. For evaluating such an ability, typical language\\nmodeling datasets that existing work uses include Penn\\nTreebank [538], WikiText-103 [539], and the Pile [161], where\\nthe metric of perplexity is commonly used for evaluating the\\nmodel performance under the zero-shot setting. Empirical\\nstudies [55, 93] show that LLMs bring substantial per-\\nformance gains over the previous state-of-the-art methods\\non these evaluation datasets. To better test the modeling\\ncapacity of long-range dependencies in text, the LAMBADA\\ndataset [233] has been introduced, where LLMs are required\\nto predict the last word of sentences based on a paragraph of\\ncontext. Then, the accuracy and perplexity of the predicted\\nlast words are employed to evaluate LLMs. As shown in\\nexisting work, the performance on the language modeling\\ntasks typically follows the scaling law [30], which means\\nthat scaling language models would improve the accuracy\\nand reduce the perplexity.\\nConditional Text Generation. As an important topic in\\nlanguage generation, conditional text generation [48] fo-\\ncuses on generating texts satisfying specific task demands\\nbased on the given conditions, typically including machine\\ntranslation [624], text summarization [548], and question\\nanswering [557]. To measure the quality of the generated\\ntext, automatic metrics ( e.g., Accuracy, BLEU [625] and\\nROUGE [626]) and human ratings have been typically used\\nfor evaluating the performance. Due to the powerful lan-\\nguage generation capabilities, LLMs have achieved remark-\\nable performance on existing datasets and benchmarks. For\\ninstance, GPT-4 exhibits comparable performance as com-\\nmercial translation products, even for the translation task of\\nlanguages that are with significant linguistic distance [627].\\nOn news summarization tasks ( i.e., CNN/DM and XSUM),\\nLLMs also demonstrate comparable performance with hu-\\nman freelance writers [628]. Despite the rapid progress\\non model capacity, there are increasing concerns on the\\nfeasibility of existing automatic metrics to faithfully assess\\nthe performance of LLMs in conditional text generation\\ntasks [628–630]. As the alternatives to automatic metrics,\\nrecent studies also propose to incorporate LLMs as gener-\\nation evaluators to examine the quality of the generated\\ncontent [138, 631, 632]. Moreover, researchers also explore\\nmore challenging language generation tasks for LLMs, such\\nas structured data generation [458] and long text genera-\\ntion [46, 633, 634].\\nCode Synthesis. In addition to generating high-quality nat-\\nural language text, existing LLMs also show strong abilities\\nto generate formal language, especially computer programs\\n(i.e., code) that satisfy specific conditions, called code syn-\\nthesis [635]. Unlike natural language generation, as the gen-\\nerated code can be directly checked by execution with cor-\\nresponding compilers or interpreters, existing work mostly\\nevaluates the quality of the generated code from LLMs by\\ncalculating the pass rate against the test cases, i.e., pass@k42.\\nRecently, several code benchmarks focusing on functional\\ncorrectness are proposed to assess the code synthesis abil-\\nities of LLMs, such as APPS [378], HumanEval [105], and\\nMBPP [208]. Typically, they consist of diverse programming\\nproblems, with text specification and test cases for cor-\\nrectness checking. To improve such an ability, it is key to\\nfine-tuning (or pre-training) LLMs on code data, which can\\neffectively adapt LLMs to code synthesis tasks [86]. In addi-\\ntion, existing work has proposed new strategies to generate\\ncode, e.g., sampling multiple candidate solutions [208] and\\nplanning-guided decoding [636], which can be considered\\nas the imitation of bug-fixing and code-planning processes\\nby programmers. Impressively, LLMs have recently shown\\ncompetitive performance with humans by achieving a rank-\\ning of the top 28% among users on the programming contest\\nplatform Codeforces [114]. Further, GitHub Copilot has been\\nreleased to assist programming in coding IDEs ( e.g., Visual\\n42. Given k programs generated by the LLM, pass@k is computed as\\n1 when at least one program passes all test cases, or else 0'),\n",

A\\nviewpoint article entitled “The End of Programming” [637] in\\nCommunications of the ACM has discussed the impact of AI\\nprogramming in the field of computer science, emphasizing\\nan important shift towards the highly adaptive LLM as a\\nnew atomic unit of computation.\\nMajor Issues. Although LLMs have achieved splendid per-\\nformance in generating human-like text, they are susceptible\\nto suffering from two major issues in language generation\\nas discussed below.\\n• Unreliable generation evaluation. With the advancement\\nof language generation ability of LLMs, existing studies\\nfind that the generated texts from LLMs have reached a\\ncomparable quality to the reference texts on a variety of text\\ngeneration tasks. However, due to the intrinsic weakness\\nof existing evaluation benchmarks, there exists pronounced\\ninconsistency between human evaluation and automatic\\nreference-based metrics [628–630, 638]. For example, in\\nOpenDialKG [551], ChatGPT underperforms a fine-tuned\\nGPT-2 on BLEU and ROUGE-L metrics, while earning more\\nfavor from human judgment [638]. Furthermore, existing\\nwork argues that even human evaluation may not be robust\\nenough [628, 629, 639, 640]. In some cases, it is difficult\\nto achieve a high level of consensus among human an-\\nnotators [629], and there is also a large gap between the\\nannotation quality of crowdworkers and experts [639, 640].\\nThus, how to conduct reliable evaluation for language gen-\\neration tasks in the era of LLMs has become a fundamental\\nyet challenging research topic. Recently, increasing research\\nwork proposes to leverage LLMs to improve the evaluation\\nquality of the generated texts. Specially, LLMs can be used\\nto improve the evaluation quality of existing metrics. For ex-\\nample, Para-Ref [641] augments various automatic metrics\\nby leveraging LLMs to paraphrase existing references into'),\n",

Nevertheless, LLMs may expose\\nbias (e.g., order bias or preference for LLM-generated texts\\nover human-written texts) as language generation evalua-\\ntors, demonstrating disparities when compared to human\\nevaluation [632, 646, 647].\\nUnreliable Generation Evaluation\\nLLMs have been capable of generating texts with\\na comparable quality to human-written texts,\\nwhich however might be underestimated by au-\\ntomatic reference-based metrics. As an alterna-\\ntive evaluation approach, LLMs can serve as lan-\\nguage generation evaluators to evaluate a single\\ntext, compare multiple candidates, and improve\\nexisting metrics. However, this evaluation ap-\\nproach still needs more inspections and exami-\\nnations in real-world tasks.\\n• Underperforming specialized generation . Although LLMs\\nhave learned general language patterns to generate coherent\\ntext, their proficiency in generation might be constrained\\nwhen dealing with a specialized domain or task. For in-\\nstance, a language model that has been trained on gen-\\neral web articles may face challenges when generating a\\nmedical report which involves many medical jargon and\\nmethods. Intuitively, domain knowledge should be critical\\nfor model specialization. However, it is not easy to inject\\nsuch specialized knowledge into LLMs. As discussed in\\nrecent analyses [47, 648], when LLMs are trained to exhibit\\nsome specific ability that allows them to excel in some areas,\\nthey might struggle in others. Such an issue is related to\\ncatastrophic forgetting [649, 650] in training neural networks,\\nwhich refers to the conflict phenomenon of integrating new\\nand old knowledge. Similar cases also occur in human align-\\nment of LLMs, where “ alignment tax” [66] ( e.g., a potential\\nloss in the in-context learning ability) has to be paid for\\naligning to human values and needs. Moreover, due to\\nthe limitations of sequence modeling architecture, LLMs\\nstill face challenges in the understanding and generation\\nof structured data. Consequently, they often fall behind\\ntask-specific models on complex structured data tasks, such\\nas knowledge-base question answering and semantic pars-\\ning [458, 651]. Therefore, it is important to develop effective\\nmodel specialization methods that can flexibly adapt LLMs\\nto various task scenarios, meanwhile retaining the original\\nabilities as possible.\\nUnderperforming Specialized Generation\\nLLMs may fall short in mastering generation\\ntasks that require domain-specific knowledge or\\ngenerating structured data. It is non-trivial to\\ninject specialized knowledge into LLMs, mean-\\nwhile maintaining the original abilities of LLMs.\\n7.1.2 Knowledge Utilization\\nKnowledge utilization is an important ability of intelligent\\nsystems to accomplish knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g., com-\\nmonsense question answering and fact completion) based\\non supporting factual evidence. Concretely, it requires LLMs\\nto properly utilize the rich factual knowledge from the pre-\\ntraining corpus or retrieve external data when necessary. In\\nparticular, question answering (QA) and knowledge com-\\npletion have been two commonly used tasks for evaluating\\nthis ability. According to the test tasks (question answering\\nor knowledge completion) and evaluation settings ( with or\\nwithout external resources), we categorize existing knowl-\\nedge utilization tasks into three types, namely closed-book\\nQA, open-book QA43, and knowledge completion.\\nClosed-Book QA. Closed-book QA tasks [652] test the\\nacquired factual knowledge of LLMs from the pre-training\\ncorpus, where LLMs should answer the question only based\\non the given context without using external resources. For\\nevaluating this ability, there are several datasets that can\\nbe leveraged, including Natural Questions [554], Web Ques-\\ntions [557], and TriviaQA [558], where the accuracy metric is\\nwidely adopted. Empirical results have revealed that LLMs\\ncan perform well in this setting and even match the per-\\nformance of state-of-the-art open-domain QA systems [56].\\nAlso, the performance of LLMs on closed-book QA tasks\\nshows a scaling law pattern in terms of both model size\\nand data size: scaling the parameters and training tokens\\ncan increase the capacity of LLMs and help them learn (or\\nmemorize) more knowledge from the pre-training data [56].\\nFurther, under a similar parameter scale, LLMs with more\\npre-training data relevant to the evaluated tasks would\\nachieve better performance [81]. Also, the closed-book QA\\nsetting provides a testbed for probing the accuracy of the\\nfactual knowledge encoded by LLMs. However, as shown\\nin existing work [55], LLMs might perform less well on QA\\ntasks relying on fine-grained knowledge, even when it exists\\nin the pre-training data.\\nOpen-Book QA. Unlike closed-book QA, in open-book QA\\ntasks, LLMs can extract useful evidence from the external\\nknowledge base or document collections, and then answer\\nthe question based on the extracted evidence [653–656]. Typ-\\nical open-book QA datasets ( e.g., Natural Questions [554],\\nOpenBookQA [566], and SQuAD [569]) have overlap with\\nclosed-book QA datasets, but they incorporate external data\\nsources, e.g., Wikipedia. The metrics of accuracy and F1\\nscore are widely used in open-book QA tasks for evalua-\\ntion. To select relevant knowledge from external resources,\\nLLMs are often paired with a text retriever (or even a\\nsearch engine), which is trained independently or jointly\\nwith LLMs [81, 653, 657]. Also, previous work [658–660]\\nhas indicated that retrievers can assist LLMs in verifying\\nand rectifying the reasoning path. In evaluation, existing\\nstudies mainly focus on testing how LLMs utilize the ex-\\ntracted knowledge to answer the question and show that\\n43. In this part, open-book QA refers to the QA tasks that require\\nto extract and utilize useful information from external knowledge\\nresources, as the antithesis of closed-book QA (only using the encoded\\ninformation from pre-training corpus). Note that there is a dataset also\\nnamed OpenBookQA [566], which follows the settings of open-book\\nQA tasks by extracting and utilizing external science facts.'),\n",

As an example\\nof intrinsic hallucination, the LLM gives a conflicting judgment about the relationship between Cindy and Amy, which\\ncontradicts the input. For extrinsic hallucination, in this example, the LLM seems to have an incorrect understanding of\\nthe meaning of RLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback), though it can correctly understand the meaning of\\nLLMs (in this context).\\nthe retrieved evidence can largely improve the accuracy\\nof the generated answers, even enabling a smaller LLM to\\noutperform 10× larger ones [653, 657]. Further, open-book\\nQA tasks can be also employed to evaluate the recency\\nof knowledge information. Pre-training or retrieving from\\noutdated knowledge resources may cause LLMs to generate\\nincorrect answers for time-sensitive questions [653].\\nKnowledge Completion. In knowledge completion tasks,\\nLLMs might be (to some extent) considered as a knowledge\\nbase [576], which can be leveraged to complete or predict the\\nmissing parts of knowledge units ( e.g., knowledge triples).\\nSuch tasks can probe and evaluate how much and what kind\\nof knowledge LLMs have learned from the pre-training\\ndata. Existing knowledge completion tasks can be roughly\\ndivided into knowledge graph completion tasks (e.g., FB15k-\\n237 [572] and WN18RR [574]) and fact completion tasks (e.g.,\\nWikiFact [571]), which aim to complete the triples from a\\nknowledge graph and incomplete sentences about specific\\nfacts, respectively. Empirical studies have revealed that it\\nis difficult for existing LLMs to accomplish knowledge\\ncompletion tasks related to specific relation types [520].\\nAs shown in the evaluation results on WikiFact, LLMs\\nperform well on several frequent relations that occur in\\nthe pre-training data ( e.g., currency and author), while\\nnot well on rare ones ( e.g., discoverer_or_inventor\\nand place_of_birth). Interestingly, under the same eval-\\nuation settings ( e.g., in-context learning), InstructGPT ( i.e.,\\ntext-davinci-002) outperforms GPT-3 in all subsets of\\nWikiFact.\\nMajor Issues. Although LLMs have achieved key progress\\nin capturing and utilizing knowledge information, they\\nsuffer from two major issues as discussed below.\\n• Hallucination. In generating factual texts, a challeng-\\ning issue is hallucination generations [638, 661], where the\\ngenerated information is either in conflict with the existing\\nsource ( intrinsic hallucination ) or cannot be verified by the\\navailable source (extrinsic hallucination), which are illustrated\\nby two examples in Figure 17. Hallucination widely occurs\\nin existing LLMs, even the most superior LLMs such as\\nGPT-4 [46]. Furthermore, existing work shows that LLMs\\nencounter difficulties in recognizing the hallucinated con-\\ntent in text [602], even the powerful ChatGPT. Additionally,\\nbeyond language tasks, a recent study has shown that large\\nvision-language models (LVLM) also face challenges with\\nhallucination, i.e., generating objects that are not present in\\nthe accompanying images [662]. In essence, LLMs seem\\nto “unconsciously” utilize the knowledge in task solving,\\nwhich still lack an ability to accurately control the use\\nof internal or external knowledge. Hallucinations would\\nmislead LLMs to generate undesired outputs and mostly\\ndegrade the performance, leading to potential risks when\\ndeploying LLMs in real-world applications. To alleviate\\nthis problem, alignment tuning strategies (as discussed in\\nSection 5.2) have been widely utilized in existing work [66],\\nwhich rely on tuning LLMs on high-quality data or using\\nhuman feedback. Moreover, the integration of external\\ntools for the provision of credible information sources can\\nhelp alleviate the hallucination issue [81, 602, 659]. Another\\nline of research work leverages uncertainty estimation of\\nLLMs to identify hallucinations [663, 664]. For instance,\\nconsidering that hallucinated facts are prone to exhibit\\ninconsistency across different sampled outputs, SelfCheck-\\nGPT [664] detects hallucination by measuring information\\ninconsistency within sampled outputs. For the evaluation\\nof the hallucination problem, a set of hallucination de-\\ntection tasks have been proposed, e.g., TruthfulQA [556]\\nfor detecting human falsehood mimicked by models. More\\nrecently, HaluEval [602] creates a large-scale LLM-generated\\nand human-annotated hallucinated samples to evaluate the\\nability of language models to recognize hallucination in both\\ntask-specific and general scenarios.\\nHallucination\\nLLMs are prone to generate untruthful informa-\\ntion that either conflicts with the existing source\\nor cannot be verified by the available source.\\nEven the most powerful LLMs such as ChatGPT\\nface great challenges in migrating the hallucina-\\ntions of the generated texts. This issue can be\\npartially alleviated by special approaches such as\\nalignment tuning and tool utilization.\\n• Knowledge recency. As another major challenge, LLMs\\nwould encounter difficulties when solving tasks that require'),\n",

To tackle\\nthis issue, a straightforward approach is to regularly update\\nLLMs with new data. However, it is very costly to fine-tune\\nLLMs, and also likely to cause the catastrophic forgetting\\nissue when incrementally training LLMs. Therefore, it is\\nnecessary to develop efficient and effective approaches that\\ncan integrate new knowledge into existing LLMs, making\\nthem up-to-date. Existing studies have explored how to\\nutilize the external knowledge source ( e.g., search engine)\\nto complement LLMs, which can be either jointly optimized\\nwith LLMs [653] or used as a plug-and-play module [659].\\nFor instance, ChatGPT utilizes a retrieval plugin to access\\nup-to-date information sources [665]. By incorporating the\\nextracted relevant information into the context [666–668],\\nLLMs can acquire new factual knowledge and perform\\nbetter on relevant tasks. However, such an approach seems\\nto be still at a superficial level. In addition, existing studies\\nalso explore editing parameters of language models to up-\\ndate intrinsic knowledge [669–671]. Nevertheless, previous\\nwork [672] has shown that several parameter editing meth-\\nods perform not well on LLMs, though they can improve\\nthe performance of small language models. Therefore, it\\nis still difficult to directly amend intrinsic knowledge or\\ninject specific knowledge into LLMs, which remains an\\nopen research problem [672]. Recently, a useful framework\\nEasyEdit [673] has been released to facilitate the research of\\nknowledge editing for LLMs.\\nKnowledge Recency\\nThe parametric knowledge of LLMs is hard to be\\nupdated in a timely manner. Augmenting LLMs\\nwith external knowledge sources is a practical\\napproach to tackling the issue. However, how\\nto effectively update knowledge within LLMs\\nremains an open research problem.\\n7.1.3 Complex Reasoning\\nComplex reasoning refers to the ability of understanding\\nand utilizing supporting evidence or logic to derive con-\\nclusions or make decisions [51, 52]. According to the type\\nof involved logic and evidence in the reasoning process,\\nwe consider dividing existing evaluation tasks into three\\nmajor categories, namely knowledge reasoning, symbolic\\nreasoning, and mathematical reasoning.\\nKnowledge Reasoning. The knowledge reasoning tasks\\nrely on logical relations and evidence about factual\\nknowledge to answer the given question. Existing work\\nmainly uses specific datasets to evaluate the reasoning\\ncapacity of the corresponding type of knowledge, e.g.,\\nCSQA [504]/StrategyQA [185] for commonsense knowledge\\nreasoning and ScienceQA [565] for science knowledge rea-\\nsoning. In addition to the accuracy of the predicted results,\\nexisting work [565] has also evaluated the quality of the\\ngenerated reasoning process, via automatic metrics ( e.g.,\\nBLEU) or human evaluation. Typically, these tasks require\\nLLMs to perform step-by-step reasoning based on factual\\nknowledge, until reaching the answer to the given ques-\\ntion. To elicit the step-by-step reasoning ability, chain-of-\\nthought (CoT) prompting strategy [33] has been proposed\\nfor enhancing the complex reasoning capacity of LLMs.\\nAs discussed in Section 6.3, CoT involves the intermediate\\nreasoning steps, which can be manually created [33] or\\nautomatically generated [674], into the prompts to guide\\nLLMs to perform multi-step reasoning. Such a way largely\\nimproves the reasoning performance of LLMs, leading to\\nnew state-of-the-art results on several complex knowledge\\nreasoning tasks [33, 56, 526]. Further, after reformulating\\nknowledge reasoning tasks into code generation tasks, re-\\nsearchers have found that the performance of LLMs can\\nbe further improved [211], especially with the LLMs pre-\\ntrained on code. However, due to the complexity of knowl-\\nedge reasoning tasks, the performance of current LLMs still\\nlags behind human results on tasks such as commonsense\\nreasoning [33, 56, 675]. As a common type of mistakes, LLMs\\nmight generate inaccurate intermediate steps, leading to a\\nwrong final result. To address this issue, existing work has\\nproposed special decoding or ensemble strategies to im-\\nprove the accuracy of the whole reasoning chain [436, 437].\\nSymbolic Reasoning 44. The symbolic reasoning tasks\\nmainly focus on manipulating the symbols in a formal rule\\nsetting to fulfill some specific goal [51], where the operations\\nand rules may have never been seen by LLMs during pre-\\ntraining. Existing work [33, 439, 505] commonly evaluates\\nLLMs on the task of last letter concatenation and coin flip,\\nwhere the evaluation examples require the same reasoning\\nsteps as the in-context examples (called in-domain test ) or\\nmore steps (called out-of-domain test ). For an example of\\nthe out-of-domain test, LLMs could only see the examples\\nwith two words in context, but it requires LLMs to concate-\\nnate the last letters of three or more words. Typically, the\\naccuracy of the generated symbols is adopted to evaluate\\nthe performance of LLMs on these tasks. Thus, LLMs need\\nto understand the semantic relations among the symbolic\\noperations and their composition in complex scenarios.\\nHowever, under the out-of-domain setting, as LLMs have\\nnot seen the complex compositions of symbolic operations\\nand rules ( e.g., twice the number of operations in context\\nexamples), it is hard for LLMs to capture their accurate\\nmeanings. To solve this issue, existing studies incorporate\\nscratchpad [591, 676] and tutor [677] strategies to help\\nLLMs better manipulate symbolic operations, for generating\\nlonger and more complex reasoning processes. Another\\nline of research work utilizes the formal programming\\nlanguage to represent the symbolic operations and rules,\\nwhich requires LLMs to generate code and perform the\\nreasoning process by executing it with external interpreters.\\nSuch a way can decompose the complex reasoning process\\ninto code synthesis and program execution for LLMs and\\ninterpreters, respectively, leading to a simplified reasoning\\nprocess with yet more accurate results [443].\\nMathematical Reasoning. The mathematical reasoning\\ntasks need to comprehensively utilize mathematical knowl-\\nedge, logic, and computation for solving problems or gen-\\nerating proof statements. Existing mathematical reasoning\\ntasks can be mainly categorized into math problem solv-\\n44. Following [33], we mainly discuss symbolic reasoning tasks spe-\\ncially designed for evaluating LLMs. We do not consider symbolic\\nreasoning methods in traditional NLP tasks, such as deducing logical\\nrules from the knowledge graphs in KBQA.'),\n",

For math problem\\nsolving tasks, SVAMP [592], GSM8k [184] and MATH [364]\\ndatasets are commonly used for evaluation, where LLMs\\nneed to generate accurate concrete numbers or equations\\nto answer the mathematical problem. As these tasks also\\nrequire multi-step reasoning, the CoT prompting strategy\\nhas been widely adopted for LLMs to improve the reasoning\\nperformance [33]. As another practical strategy, continu-\\nally pre-training LLMs on large-scale mathematical corpora\\ncan largely boost their performance on mathematical rea-\\nsoning tasks [35, 203, 678]. Further, since math problems\\nin different languages share the same mathematical logic,\\nresearchers also propose a multilingual math word problem\\nbenchmark [524] to evaluate the multilingual mathematical\\nreasoning capacity of LLMs. As another challenging task,\\nautomated theorem proving (ATP) [598, 600, 679] requires\\nthe reasoning model to strictly follow the reasoning logic\\nand mathematical skills. To evaluate the performance on\\nthis task, PISA [599] and miniF2F [600] are two typical ATP\\ndatasets with the proof success rate as the evaluation metric.\\nAs a typical approach, existing work on ATP utilizes LLMs\\nto aid the search for proofs using an interactive theorem\\nprover (ITP), such as Lean, Metamath, and Isabelle [680–\\n682]. A major limitation of ATP research is the lack of related\\ncorpora in formal language. To tackle it, several studies\\nutilize LLMs to convert informal statements into formal\\nproofs for augmenting new data [683] or generate drafts and\\nproof sketches to reduce the search space of the proofs [684].\\nMajor Issues. In spite of the advancements, LLMs still have\\nseveral limitations in solving complex reasoning tasks.\\n• Reasoning inconsistency . With improved reasoning\\nstrategies (e.g., CoT prompting), LLMs can solve some com-\\nplex reasoning tasks, by performing step-by-step reasoning\\nbased on the supporting logic and evidence. Despite the\\neffectiveness, the reasoning inconsistency issue often occurs in\\nthe decomposed reasoning process. Concretely, LLMs may\\ngenerate the correct answer following an invalid reasoning\\npath, or produce a wrong answer after a correct reason-\\ning process [33, 442], leading to inconsistency between the\\nderived answer and the reasoning process. To alleviate\\nthis problem, existing work has proposed to guide the\\nwhole generation process of LLMs via external tools or\\nmodels [437, 451, 636], to re-check the reasoning process\\nand final answer for correcting the potential errors [685–687]\\nor fine-tune LLMs with process-based feedback [688, 689].\\nFor instance, Tree of Thoughts (ToT) [451] empowers LLMs\\nto engage in the decision-making process by concurrently\\nexploring and self-evaluating various reasoning paths. To\\nrefine the reasoning processes, Self-Refine [685] elicits feed-\\nback from LLMs on self-generated solutions, enabling the\\niterative refinement of solutions based on the feedback.\\nMoreover, several studies improve the consistency in the\\nreasoning chain of LLMs through the integration of process-\\nbased supervision during training [688, 689]. As a promis-\\ning solution, recent approaches reformulate the complex\\nreasoning tasks into code generation tasks, where the strict\\nexecution of the generated code ensures the consistency\\nbetween the reasoning process and the outcome. Also,\\nit has been revealed that there might exist inconsistency\\nbetween tasks with similar inputs, where small changes\\nin the task description may cause the model to produce\\ndifferent results [49, 592]. To mitigate this problem, self-\\nconsistency [436] adopts the ensemble of multiple reasoning\\npaths to enhance the decoding process of LLMs.\\nReasoning Inconsistency\\nLLMs may generate the correct answer following\\nan invalid reasoning path, or produce a wrong\\nanswer after a correct reasoning process, leading\\nto inconsistency between the derived answer and\\nthe reasoning process. The issue can be alleviated\\nby fine-tuning LLMs with process-level feedback,\\nusing an ensemble of diverse reasoning paths,\\nand refining the reasoning process with self-\\nreflection or external feedback.\\n• Numerical computation . For complex reasoning tasks,\\nLLMs still face difficulties in the involved numerical com-\\nputation, especially for the symbols that are seldom en-\\ncountered during pre-training, such as arithmetic with large\\nnumbers [49, 677, 690]. To tackle this issue, a direct way is\\nto tune LLMs on synthesized arithmetic problems [361, 691].\\nAlso, a surge of studies improve the numerical computation\\nperformance by tracing intermediate calculation steps in\\ntraining and inference stages [361, 676, 692], e.g., scratchpad\\ntracing. In addition, existing work [80] has also incorpo-\\nrated external tools (e.g., calculator), especially for handling\\narithmetic operations. More recently, ChatGPT has provided\\na plugin mechanism to use external tools [665]. In this\\nway, LLMs need to learn how to properly manipulate the\\ntools. For this purpose, researchers have augmented the\\nexamples using tools (even the LLM itself) for tuning the\\nLLM [80, 693], or devised instructions and exemplars for\\nin-context learning [443]. In addition to the aid of ex-\\nternal tools, recent studies find that tokenizing digits into\\nindividual tokens ( e.g., LLaMA and Galactica tokenizers)\\nis a useful approach to enhancing the inherent arithmetic\\nability of LLMs [361, 690]. One possible explanation is that\\nsubword tokenization techniques can result in inconsistent\\nsequences when tokenizing numbers. For instance, with\\na subword tokenizer the integer 7481 may be tokenized\\nas 7 481, while 74815 may be tokenized as 748 15 (the\\nsame numerical substrings with different splits) [361]. As a\\ncomparison, digit-based tokenization for numbers can avoid\\nsuch an inconsistency, thus likely improving the numerical\\ncomputation ability of LLMs.\\nNumerical Computation\\nLLMs face difficulties in numerical computation,\\nespecially for the symbols that are seldom en-\\ncountered during pre-training. In addition to us-\\ning mathematical tools, tokenizing digits into in-\\ndividual tokens is also an effective design choice\\nfor improving the arithmetic ability of LLMs.\\n7.2 Advanced Ability\\nIn addition to the above basic evaluation tasks, LLMs also\\nexhibit some superior abilities that require special consider-'),\n",

In this part, we discuss several rep-\\nresentative advanced abilities and the corresponding eval-\\nuation approaches, including human alignment, interaction\\nwith the external environment, and tool manipulation. Next,\\nwe discuss these advanced abilities in detail.\\n7.2.1 Human Alignment\\nIt is desired that LLMs could well conform to human values\\nand needs, i.e., human alignment, which is a key ability for\\nthe broad use of LLMs in real-world applications.\\nTo evaluate this ability, existing studies consider multiple\\ncriteria for human alignment, such as helpfulness, honesty,\\nand safety [46, 170, 368]. For helpfulness and honesty, adver-\\nsarial question answering tasks ( e.g., TruthfulQA [556]) can\\nbe utilized to examine LLM’s ability in detecting possible\\nfalsehood in the text [46, 81]. Furthermore, harmlessness\\ncan be also evaluated by several existing benchmarks, e.g.,\\nCrowS-Pairs [603] and Winogender [604]. Despite the auto-\\nmatic evaluation with the above datasets, human evaluation\\nis still a more direct way to effectively test the human\\nalignment ability of LLMs. OpenAI invites many experts\\nin domains related to AI risks to evaluate and improve the\\nbehaviors of GPT-4 when encountering risky contents [46].\\nIn addition, for other aspects of human alignment ( e.g.,\\ntruthfulness), several studies propose to use specific instruc-\\ntions and devise annotation rules to guide the annotation\\nprocess [81]. Empirical studies have revealed that these\\nstrategies can greatly improve the human alignment ability\\nof LLMs [170]. For instance, after alignment tuning on data\\ncollected through interactions with experts, the incorrect\\nbehavior rate of GPT-4 can be largely reduced when it deals\\nwith sensitive or disallowed prompts. In addition, high-\\nquality pre-training data can reduce the effort required for\\nalignment [46]. For instance, Galactica is potentially more\\nharmless due to the less biased contents in the scientific\\ncorpus [35].\\n7.2.2 Interaction with External Environment\\nIn addition to standard evaluation tasks, LLMs have the\\nability to receive feedback from the external environment\\nand perform actions according to the behavior instruction,\\ne.g., generating action plans in natural language to manip-\\nulate agents [694, 695]. Such an ability is also emergent in\\nLLMs that can generate detailed and highly realistic action\\nplans, while smaller models ( e.g., GPT-2) tend to generate\\nshorter or meaningless plans [694].\\nTo test this ability, several embodied AI environments\\nand benchmarks can be used for evaluation, described\\nas follows. VirtualHome [606] builds a 3D simulator for\\nhousehold tasks such as cleaning and cooking, in which\\nthe agent can execute natural language actions generated\\nby LLMs. ALFRED [608] includes more challenging tasks\\nthat require LLMs to accomplish compositional targets. BE-\\nHAVIOR [607] focuses on everyday chores in simulation\\nenvironments and requires LLMs to generate complex so-\\nlutions, e.g., changing the internal status of objects. Apart\\nfrom restricted environments such as household tasks, a\\nline of research work investigates the proficiency of LLM-\\nbased agents to explore open-world environments, such as\\nMinecraft and the Internet [696, 697]. Voyager [697] intro-\\nduces an automatic curriculum module that enables LLMs\\nto continuously acquire new skills based on feedback from\\nthe environment. GITM [696] focuses on solving various\\nchallenges in Minecraft based on LLM, through task de-\\ncomposition, planning, and invocation of interfaces. Based\\non the generated action plans or task completions, existing\\nwork either adopts the regular metrics ( e.g., executability\\nand correctness of the generated action plans) [694] in the\\nbenchmark or directly conducts real-world experiments and\\nmeasures the success rate [698], to evaluate such ability. It\\nhas been shown that LLMs are capable in interacting with\\nthe external environment and generating accurate action\\nplans [699]. Recently, several improvement methods have\\nbeen proposed to enhance the interaction ability of LLMs,\\ne.g., designing code-like prompts [530] and providing real-\\nworld grounding [698].\\nIn addition, recent work also explores multi-agent col-\\nlaboration based on LLMs in simulated environments [533,\\n700, 701]. These studies simulate human social behaviors\\nby instantiating multiple LLM-based agents with observa-\\ntions, planning, and memories in a sandbox environment.\\nIn controlled evaluation, the abilities of generative agents\\nto search, plan, and think are evaluated by humans in an\\ninterview-like manner. Further, they also conduct descrip-\\ntive measurements on multiple agents within a simulated\\nenvironment to examine emergent social behaviors.\\n7.2.3 Tool Manipulation\\nWhen solving complex problems, LLMs can turn to external\\ntools if they determine it is necessary. By encapsulating\\navailable tools with API calls, existing work has involved\\na variety of external tools, e.g., search engine [81], calcula-\\ntor [80], and compiler [443], to enhance the performance of\\nLLMs on several specific tasks. Recently, OpenAI has sup-\\nported the use of plugins in ChatGPT [665], which can equip\\nLLMs with broader capacities beyond language modeling.\\nFor example, the web browser plugin enables ChatGPT\\nto access fresh information. Further, incorporating third-\\nparty plugins is particularly key for creating a prosperous\\necosystem of applications based on LLMs.\\nTo examine the ability of tool manipulation, existing\\nwork mostly adopts complex reasoning tasks for evaluation,\\nsuch as mathematical problem solving ( e.g., GSM8k [184]\\nand SVAMP [592]) or knowledge question answering ( e.g.,\\nTruthfulQA [556]), where the successful utilization of tools is\\nvery important for enhancing the required skills that LLMs\\nare incapable in (e.g., numerical calculation). In this way, the\\nevaluated performance on these tasks can reflect the ability\\nof LLMs in tool manipulation. To teach LLMs to utilize tools,\\nexisting studies add exemplars using tools in context to elicit\\nLLMs [443], or fine-tune LLMs on simulated data about\\ntool utilization [80, 693]. It has been found that with the\\nhelp of tools, LLMs become more capable of handling the\\nissues that they are not good at, e.g., equation calculation\\nand answering timely questions [80, 448]. However, as\\nthe number of available tools increases, the limited context\\nlength of LLMs may pose challenges in describing and\\ndemonstrating extensive tool APIs. To address this issue,\\nexisting work retrieves the usage of relevant tools, or en-\\ncoding tool information as tokens within the embedding\\nspace [702–704].'),\n",

This enables the models\\nto independently explore and manipulate these self-created\\ntools, thereby expanding their potential for autonomous\\nexploration in solving a wide range of real-world tasks.\\nSummary. The above three abilities are of great value to\\nthe practical performance of LLMs: conforming to human\\nvalues and preferences (human alignment), acting properly\\nin real-world scenarios (interaction with the external envi-\\nronment), and expanding the ability scope (tool manipu-\\nlation). In addition to the above three advanced abilities,\\nLLMs might also show other abilities that are specially\\nrelated to some tasks (e.g., data annotation [486]) or learning\\nmechanisms (e.g., self-improvement [706]). It will be an open\\ndirection to discover, measure and evaluate these newly\\nemerging abilities, so as to better utilize and improve LLMs.\\n7.3 Benchmarks and Evaluation Approaches\\nIn the above, we have discussed the basic and advanced\\nabilities of LLMs. Next, we will introduce existing evalua-\\ntion benchmarks and approaches [733, 734].\\n7.3.1 Comprehensive Evaluation Benchmarks\\nRecently, several comprehensive benchmarks [70, 364, 520]\\nhave been released for the evaluation of LLMs. In this\\npart, we introduce several widely used benchmarks, i.e.,\\nMMLU, BIG-bench, HELM, and a series of human exam\\nbenchmarks.\\n• MMLU [364] is a versatile benchmark for large-scale\\nevaluation of multi-task knowledge understanding, cover-\\ning a wide range of knowledge domains from mathematics\\nand computer science to humanities and social sciences. The\\ndifficulties of these tasks vary from basic to advanced. As\\nshown in existing work, LLMs mostly outperform small\\nmodels by a substantial margin on this benchmark [35, 56,\\n57, 69], which shows the scaling law in model size. More\\nrecently, GPT-4 achieves a remarkable record (86.4% in 5-\\nshot setting) in MMLU, which is significantly better than\\nthe previous state-of-the-art models [46].\\n• BIG-bench [70] is a collaborative benchmark intended\\nto probe existing LLMs from various aspects. It comprises\\n204 tasks that encompass a broad range of topics, includ-\\ning linguistics, childhood development, mathematics, com-\\nmonsense reasoning, biology, physics, social bias, software\\ndevelopment, and so on. By scaling the model size, LLMs\\ncan even outperform the average human performance under\\nthe few-shot setting on 65% of tasks in BIG-bench [56].\\nConsidering the high evaluation cost of the entire bench-\\nmark, a lightweight benchmark BIG-bench-Lite has been\\nproposed, which contains 24 small yet diverse and challeng-\\ning tasks from BIG-bench. Additionally, the BIG-bench hard\\n(BBH) benchmark [365] has been proposed to concentrate\\non investigating the currently unsolvable tasks of LLMs by\\nselecting the challenging tasks in which LLMs exhibit infe-\\nrior performance compared to humans. Since BBH becomes\\nmore difficult, small models mostly achieve performance\\nclose to random. As a comparison, CoT prompting can\\nelicit the abilities of LLMs to perform step-by-step reasoning\\nfor enhancing the performance, even exceeding the average\\nhuman performance in BBH.\\n• HELM [520] is a comprehensive benchmark that cur-\\nrently implements a core set of 16 scenarios and 7 categories\\nof metrics. It is built on top of many prior studies, conduct-\\ning a holistic evaluation of language models. As shown in\\nthe experimental results of HELM, instruction tuning can\\nconsistently boost the performance of LLMs in terms of\\naccuracy, robustness, and fairness. Further, for reasoning\\ntasks, the LLMs that have been pre-trained on the code\\ncorpus show superior performance.\\n• Human-level test benchmarks aim to evaluate the compre-\\nhensive ability of LLMs with questions designed for testing\\nhumans, such as AGIEval [708], MMCU [709], M3KE [710],\\nC-Eval [711] and Xiezhi [712]. These benchmarks encompass\\na wide range of domains, difficulty levels, and languages\\nto provide a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs’ general\\ncapabilities. Compared to publicly available models, models\\noffering API services (e.g., GPT-4, ChatGPT, Claude) demon-\\nstrate superior performance compared to publicly avail-\\nable models on these evaluation benchmarks. As the best-\\nperforming model in evaluations, GPT-4 surpasses average\\nhuman performance in AGIEval [708]. However, it still lags\\nbehind the top human performance on these challenging\\nbenchmarks. Hence, there remains ample room for further\\nenhancements in the overall abilities of LLMs, particularly\\nfor publicly accessible models.\\nThe above benchmarks cover a variety of mainstream\\nevaluation tasks and real-world human exam questions for\\nthe evaluation of LLMs. Also, there are several benchmarks\\nthat focus on evaluating specific abilities of LLMs, such\\nas TyDiQA [735] for multilingual knowledge utilization\\nand MGSM [524] for multilingual mathematical reasoning.\\nTo conduct the evaluation, one can select suitable bench-\\nmarks according to specific goals. In addition, there are also\\nseveral open-source evaluation frameworks for researchers\\nto evaluate LLMs on existing benchmarks or extend new\\ntasks for customized evaluations, such as Language Model\\nEvaluation Harness [736] and OpenAI Evals [46]. Fur-\\nther, some researchers also construct continuously updated\\nleaderboards by aggregating representative benchmarks, to\\ncompare the performance of existing LLMs, such as Open\\nLLM Leaderboard [707]. The above benchmarks and leader-\\nboards provide important references to demonstrate the ba-\\nsic and advanced abilities of LLMs. We will give more deep\\ndiscussions on pros and cons on evaluation approaches in\\nSection 7.3.2.\\n7.3.2 Evaluation Approaches\\nAfter introducing existing benchmarks, in this part, we\\nwill review existing evaluation approaches for assessing\\nthe performance of LLMs. To organize our discussion, we\\ncategorize LLMs into three different types: base LLMs (pre-\\ntrained model checkpoints), fine-tuned LLMs (instruction or\\nalignment fine-tuned model checkpoints), and specialized\\nLLMs (adapted model checkpoints for some specific task\\nor domain). Here, we keep both fine-tuned LLMs and\\nspecialized LLMs, to distinguish the different purposes of\\nLLMs: general or specific task solvers. To evaluate the three\\ntypes of LLMs, we can test the LLM’s performance related\\nto different abilities ( e.g., basic or advanced abilities as'),\n",

In general, there are three\\nmain approaches to evaluating LLMs, namely benchmark-\\nbased approach [364], human-based approach [727], and\\nmodel-based approach [729]. Table 15 shows an illustration\\nof the relationship among LLM type, evaluation approach,\\nand tested abilities. Next, we will discuss the evaluation\\napproaches for different types of LLMs.\\nEvaluation of Base LLMs. Base LLMs refer to the model\\ncheckpoints obtained right after pre-training. For base\\nLLMs, we mainly focus on examining the basic abilities\\n(Section 7.1), such as complex reasoning and knowledge\\nutilization. Since most of these basic abilities can be assessed\\nwith well-defined tasks, benchmark-based approaches have\\nbeen widely used to evaluate base LLMs. Next, we will\\nintroduce common evaluation benchmarks and evaluation\\nprocedures for base LLMs.\\n• Common benchmarks. To evaluate base LLMs, typical\\nbenchmarks are designed in the form of close-ended prob-\\nlems like multiple-choice questions. These commonly used\\nbenchmarks can be mainly divided into two categories:\\nknowledge-oriented and reasoning-oriented benchmarks.\\nKnowledge-oriented benchmarks (e.g., MMLU [364] and C-\\nEval [711]) aim to evaluate the capacity of world knowledge,\\nwhile reasoning-oriented benchmarks ( e.g., GSM8K [643],\\nBBH [365], and MATH [364]) focus on evaluating the ca-\\npability of solving complex reasoning tasks. Further, some\\nrecently proposed benchmarks ( e.g., OpenCompass [713])\\ncombine these two types for a comprehensive comparison.\\n• Benchmark based evaluation procedure. To perform the\\nbenchmark evaluation, each problem will first be formatted\\ninto a prompt for LLMs to generate the result text. Then,\\nthe generated result text will be parsed with human-written\\nrules to get the predicted answer. Finally, the performance\\nof LLMs can be automatically calculated using standard\\nmetrics like accuracy by comparing the predicted answer\\nwith the ground-truth one. The evaluation approach can be\\nconducted in either the few-shot or zero-shot setting, which\\nmight lead to different evaluation results or rankings. Since\\nbase LLMs have not been instruction fine-tuned (with rela-\\ntively weak task generalization ability), the few-shot setting\\nis often more suitable for evaluation. For some complex\\nreasoning tasks, CoT prompts also need to be used to fully\\nexhibit the capacity during evaluation. Another note is that\\nthis evaluation approach can also be applied to assess the\\nabilities of fine-tuned LLMs. Actually, several leaderboards\\n(e.g., Open LLM Leaderboard [707]) are built upon this\\napproach, evaluating both base and fine-tuned LLMs.\\nEvaluation of Fine-tuned LLMs. Fine-tuned LLMs in this\\npart refer to the model checkpoints obtained after in-\\nstruction tuning or alignment tuning based on pre-trained\\nmodel weights45. Typically, fine-tuned LLMs will be tested\\n45. In some cases, it is also called chat models.'),\n",

In addition\\nto benchmark-based evaluation, human-based and model-\\nbased approaches have also been widely used to evaluate\\nthe advanced abilities of fine-tuned LLMs. Next, we will\\nintroduce the two evaluation methods.\\n• Human-based evaluation. Unlike automatic evaluation\\nfor basic abilities, human evaluation typically considers\\nmore factors or abilities in real-world use, such as hu-\\nman alignment and tool manipulation. In this evaluation\\napproach, test tasks are usually in the form of open-\\nended questions, and human evaluators are invited to make\\njudgments on the quality of answers generated by LLMs.\\nTypically, there are two main types of scoring methods\\nfor human evaluators: pairwise comparison and single-\\nanswer grading. In pairwise comparison, given the same\\nquestion, humans are assigned two answers from different\\nmodels to determine which one is better, while in single-\\nanswer grading, they only need to score a single answer\\nat a time. For example, HELM [520] employs humans\\nto perform single-answer grading on summarization and\\ndisinformation tasks, while Chatbot Arena [727] constructs\\na crowdsourcing platform that allows users to engage in\\nconversations with two anonymous chat LLMs and report\\npairwise comparison results.\\n• Model-based evaluation. Since human-based evaluation\\nis both expensive and time-consuming, some work has\\nproposed leveraging powerful closed-source LLMs such\\nas ChatGPT and GPT-4 as a surrogate for human evalu-\\nators [727, 729]. For example, AlpacaEval [729] collects a\\nset of instructions and utilizes a capable LLM ( e.g., GPT-4)\\nas the judge to perform pair-wise comparisons against the\\nreference outputs. Furthermore, MT-bench [727] collects a\\nset of multi-turn questions for evaluation and improves the\\nreliability of LLM-based evaluators through methods like\\nICL and CoT. Compared with human evaluators, LLMs such\\nas ChatGPT and GPT-4 can achieve high agreement with\\nhumans, in both small-scale handcrafted and large-scale\\ncrowdsourced evaluation tasks. Despite this, these closed-\\nsource LLMs are limited in access and have the potential\\nrisk of data leakage. To address this, recent work [727] has\\nexplored fine-tuning open-source LLMs ( e.g., Vicuna [138])\\nas model evaluators using scoring data from human eval-\\nuators, which has narrowed the gap with powerful closed-\\nsource LLMs (e.g., GPT-4).\\nEvaluation of Specialized LLMs. Specialized LLMs refer\\nto the model checkpoints specially adapted to some do-\\nmains or applications like healthcare [356] and finance [737].\\nAs special task solvers, specialized LLMs will be tested\\nnot only on general abilities ( e.g., basic ability like com-\\nplex reasoning and advanced ability like human align-\\nment), but also on specific abilities related to their des-\\nignated domains or applications. For this purpose, one\\noften needs to construct specific benchmarks tailored for the\\ntarget domains or applications. Then, these domain-specific\\nbenchmarks can be combined with general benchmarks to\\nconduct both comprehensive and targeted evaluation for\\nspecialized LLMs. For example, MultiMedQA [356] is a\\nspecific benchmark in healthcare, which includes medical\\nexaminations and healthcare questions. In this work [356],\\nMultiMedQA has been combined with MMLU [364] to\\nassess the performance of specialized LLMs for healthcare,\\nsuch as Med-PaLM [356]. Similarly, FLUE [737] constructs a\\nbenchmark for finance, spanning from financial sentiment\\nanalysis to question answering. It has been used collab-\\noratively with BBH [365] to evaluate finical LLMs like\\nBloombergGPT [360].\\nPros and Cons of Different Evaluation Approaches . In the\\nabove, we have discussed different evaluation approaches\\nto assess the abilities of LLMs. Next, we simply analyze the\\npros and cons of each evaluation approach.\\n• Benchmark-based approach. This evaluation approach can\\nleverage existing benchmarks for assessing the performance\\nof LLMs. The tasks involved in these benchmarks often\\ncontain sufficient test samples to measure the core abilities\\n(e.g., reasoning). The whole evaluation procedure can be\\n(almost) automatic, and it is convenient to carry out test\\nexperiments for various base LLMs, especially useful for\\nmonitoring the performance of model checkpoints during\\npre-training. However, LLMs are often sensitive to the eval-\\nuation settings, including the question prompts, zero-shot or\\nfew-shot tests, and the answer parsing methods. Thus, one\\nshould take possible influencing factors into consideration\\nwhen conducting the evaluation experiments. The evalua-\\ntion results should be noted with the adopted evaluation\\nsettings. Another issue is the data contamination [56, 738],\\ni.e., the test data itself or relevant content has been contained\\nin the pre-training corpora. This phenomenon has become\\nincreasingly severe since more and more open data has been\\ncollected for developing LLMs.\\n• Human-based approach. Human evaluation offers several\\nadvantages when assessing the capabilities of LLMs to solve\\nreal-world tasks. One of the key benefits is its ability to\\ndirectly reflect the actual abilities of LLMs. Based on feed-\\nback and experiences from real users, human evaluation\\nprovides a more direct measure of LLMs’ performance in\\nreal-world scenarios. Further, it can conduct more flexible\\nand diverse evaluation tasks based on human evaluators.\\nFor instance, users can submit various queries and test the\\nabilities of LLMs according to their own task cognition. It\\nallows for a deep understanding of the strengths and weak-\\nnesses of LLMs across different types of tasks and contexts.\\nHowever, human evaluation also has inherent limitations\\nthat could potentially affect its accuracy and consistency.\\nFactors such as personalized tastes and varying education\\nlevels among evaluators can introduce biases or even incon-\\nsistencies in the evaluation process. In some cases, users’\\njudgments are likely to be subjective, which may not reflect\\nthe true capabilities of the LLMs. Moreover, conducting\\nrobust and reliable human evaluations often requires a large\\nnumber of evaluators, which can be very expensive and\\ntime-consuming. In addition, human evaluation is often\\nnot reproducible, making it infeasible to extend existing\\nevaluation results or track the progress of LLMs.\\n• Model-based approach. As a surrogate for human-based\\napproaches, model-based approaches serve to diminish the\\nreliance on human involvement, and enable more efficient\\nand scalable evaluation. In addition, LLMs can provide\\nmeaningful explanations for the assigned rating scores,'),\n",

De-\\nspite their scalability and explanability, model-based ap-\\nproaches have been found to suffer from several issues, in-\\ncluding position, verbosity, and self-enhancement bias [727].\\nSpecially, position bias ( i.e., the order to present the re-\\nsponses) refers to the fact that LLMs tend to assign high\\nscores for the answers at specific positions over others,\\nverbosity bias means that LLMs favor verbose answers even\\nif they are short in quality compared with shorter answers,\\nand self-enhancement bias indicates that LLMs often over-\\nrate in their own generations. In addition, since LLMs have\\nlimited capacities in solving complex reasoning problems,\\nthey cannot serve as qualified evaluators for some difficult\\ntasks ( e.g., mathematical reasoning). These limitations can\\nbe mitigated to some extent by specific prompt engineering\\nand fine-tuning strategies [727].\\nTo summarize, our categorization (Table 15) of existing\\nwork on LLM evaluation is mainly based on two major di-\\nmensions, namely evaluation methodology and model type,\\nwhich are further extended with the test abilities. There\\nare some recent work [733, 734] that also has discussed\\nthe categorization or taxonomies of existing work for LLM\\nevaluation.\\n7.4 Empirical Evaluation\\nThe above evaluation benchmarks and approaches are\\nmainly employed to evaluate the overall abilities of LLMs.\\nIn this part, we conduct a fine-grained evaluation of the\\nabilities discussed in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2. For each\\nkind of ability, we select representative tasks and datasets\\nfor conducting evaluation experiments to examine the cor-\\nresponding performance of LLMs.\\n7.4.1 Experimental Settings\\nIn this part, we introduce the experimental settings for our\\nevaluation.\\nEvaluation Models. To conduct the evaluation, we consider\\nrepresentative LLMs from open-source models to closed-\\nsource API-accessing models as follows:\\n• Open-source models. Existing open-source models can be\\ncategorized into base models and instruction-tuned models.\\nBase models are only pre-trained on a large general-purpose\\ncorpus with the language modeling objective, but without\\nfurther supervised fine-tuning. In our evaluation, we select\\nfour representative base models including LLaMA (7B) [57],\\nLLaMA 2 (7B) [99], Pythia (7B and 12B) [96], and Falcon\\n(7B) [747] 46. Instruction-tuned models are those fine-tuned\\nusing instructions ( i.e., task datasets, daily chat, or syn-\\nthetic instructions). In our experiments, we select four rep-\\nresentative instruction-tuned models including Vicuna (7B\\nand 13B) [138], Alpaca (7B) [137], and ChatGLM (6B) [93].\\nIn addition, we also include LLaMA 2-Chat (7B) [99] for\\ncomparison, and it is a representative model that has been\\naligned with human via instruction tuning and RLHF, based\\non LLaMA 2 (7B).\\n• Closed-source models. In addition to the open-source\\nmodels, there are also closed-source models that can only\\n46. Experiments with larger models are still in schedule due to the\\nlimit of computational resources.\\nbe accessed via APIs, which have gained much attention\\nfrom both developers and researchers. Here, we select four\\nrepresentative closed-source models including text-davinci-\\n002/003 (short as Davinci002/003), ChatGPT, Claude, and\\nClaude 2, where the first three models are developed by\\nOpenAI and the other two are developed by Anthropic.\\nTasks and Datasets. Next, we set up the evaluation tasks\\nand datasets for the abilities discussed in Section 7.1 and\\nSection 7.2. We mainly evaluate the zero-shot performance\\nof LLMs on these datasets. For more complex tasks that are\\nhard to be solved in the zero-shot manner ( e.g., mathemati-\\ncal reasoning and tool manipulation), we mainly report the\\n3-shot performance, considering the context length limit of\\nopen-source models.\\n• Language generation. As discussed before, for language\\ngeneration, we consider evaluating three kinds of tasks,\\ni.e., language modeling, conditional text generation, and\\ncode synthesis. Specially, we select four commonly-used\\ndatasets, namely LAMBADA [233] (language modeling),\\nWMT’22 [545] (machine translation), XSum [549] (text sum-\\nmarization), and HumanEval [105] (code synthesis) for eval-\\nuation. In WMT’22, we construct a new evaluation set\\nby selecting 1000 examples for each language pair from\\nthe original large-scale test set to examine the average\\nperformance of LLMs in machine translation. We evaluate\\nthe zero-shot performance of LLMs on these datasets, and\\ncompute the accuracy of predicting words for LAMBADA,\\nBLEU-4 for WMT’22, ROUGE-L for XSum, and pass@10 for\\nHumanEval.\\n• Knowledge utilization. To evaluate the ability of knowl-\\nedge utilization, we select four question answering datasets\\n(i.e., TriviaQA [558], Natural Questions [554], Web Ques-\\ntions [557], and ARC [555]), and a fact extraction dataset,\\nWikiFact [571]. We also report the zero-shot performance of\\nLLMs on these datasets, and compute accuracy for ARC and\\nexact match for other datasets.\\n• Complex reasoning. For complex reasoning, we eval-\\nuate the comparison models on OpenbookQA [566], Hel-\\nlaSwag [582], and SocialIQA [581] for knowledge reason-\\ning; Colored Objects [70] and Penguins in the Table [70]\\nfor symbolic reasoning; GSM8k [184] and MATH [364] for\\nmathematical reasoning. We compute theaccuracy for Open-\\nbookQA, HellaSwag, and SocialIQA; solve rate for Colored\\nObjects and Penguins in the Table; and accuracy for GSM8k\\nand MATH. For knowledge reasoning tasks, we evaluate\\nthe zero-shot performance, since they are all QA tasks that\\ncan be solved in a zero-shot setting. For complex symbolic\\nreasoning and mathematical reasoning tasks, we leverage\\n3-shot in-context exemplars to better elicit LLMs to accom-\\nplish them. Following existing work [33, 443], we also utilize\\nthe chain-of-thought prompting strategy for better solving\\nthe mathematical reasoning tasks.\\n• Human alignment. For human alignment, we select\\nTruthfulQA [556] to measure whether a LLM is truth-\\nful in generating answers to questions, CrowS-Pairs [603]\\nand WinoGender [604] to assess the stereotypes in LLMs,\\nRealToxityPrompts [605] to evaluate the extent to which\\nLLMs generate toxic language, and HaluEval [602] to test\\nthe ability of LLMs to recognize hallucination. As the test\\nset of Real-Toxicity-Prompts is too large, we randomly'),\n",

For tool manipulation, we consider\\ntwo kinds of tools including search engine and model in-\\nterfaces. Therefore, we adopt two tool manipulation bench-\\nmarks, i.e., HotpotQA [579] and Gorilla [617].

To reproduce our experi-\\nments, we also publicly release our experimental code and\\ndata in https://github.com/RUCAIBox/LLMSurvey/tree/\\nmain/Experiments.\\n7.4.2 Results Analysis and Findings\\nWe report the experimental results in Table 16, and analyze\\nthe results in the following.\\nAnalysis of Closed-Source Models. We summarize our\\nanalysis and findings of the four closed-source models ( i.e.,\\nChatGPT, Claude, Davinci003 and Davinci002) as follows:\\n• These five closed-source models achieve promising results\\nas general-purpose task solvers, in which ChatGPT mostly per-\\nforms the best. ChatGPT, Claude, Claude 2, Davinci003 and\\nDavinci002 perform well in most of tasks, including com-\\nplex tasks ( e.g., GSM8k), which have shown great potential\\nto be general-purpose task solvers. Among them, ChatGPT\\nexhibits a more superior model capacity on the evaluation\\ntasks, winning the most across all tasks. In some evaluation\\ntasks, the performance gap between ChatGPT and other\\nclosed-source models is very large, especially for complex\\ntasks e.g., 78.47 (ChatGPT) v.s. 49.96 (Davinci002) on GSM8k,\\nand 79.88 (ChatGPT) v.s. 51.22 (Claude) on HumanEval.\\n• Claude 2, ChatGPT and Davinci003 perform better on inter-\\naction with environment and tool manipulation tasks.On the two\\nevaluation tasks, Claude 2, ChatGPT and Davinci003, per-\\nform better than other models by a large margin, e.g., 36.40\\n(Claude 2) v.s. 26.00 (Davinci002) on HotpotQA, 44.53 (Chat-\\nGPT) v.s. 7.74 (Claude) on Gorilla-TF, and 72.58 (Davinci003)\\nv.s. 22.04 (Claude) on Gorilla-TH. A possible reason is that\\nthese three models have been specially optimized towards\\nthese advanced abilities, e.g., supporting the use of external\\nplugins.\\n• All the comparison models perform not well on very diffi-\\ncult reasoning tasks. On MATH and HotpotQA, all models\\n(including ChatGPT) perform not well. The two tasks are\\nvery difficult to solve, requiring accurate understanding of\\ncomplex mathematical knowledge and performing multi-\\nhop reasoning across documents, respectively. Further, these\\nmodels also have a relatively weak performance on machine\\ntranslation task (WMT). A possible reason is that WMT also\\ncontains many evaluation examples in minor languages,\\nwhich might not be well covered in the pre-training data\\nof these LLMs.\\nAnalysis of Open-Source Models. Next, we continue to\\nshow our analysis and findings about eight open-source\\nmodels ( i.e., LLaMA 2-Chat, Vicuna, Alpaca, ChatGLM,\\nLLaMA 2, LLaMA, Pythia and Falcon) as follows:\\n• Instruction-tuned models mostly perform better than the\\nbase models. Among all the compared open-source methods,\\nthe instruction-tuned models ( i.e., LLaMA 2-Chat, Vicuna,\\nAlpaca and ChatGLM) mostly perform better than non-\\ninstruction-tuned models ( i.e., LLaMA 2, LLaMA, Pythia\\nand Falcon). It indicates that instruction tuning is generally\\ncapable of improving the few-shot or zero-shot ability of\\nLLMs in solving various tasks. However, after instruction\\ntuning, Vicuna (7B) and Alpaca (7B) suffer from perfor-\\nmance degradations on LAMBADA, a language modeling\\ntask. The reason may be that the instruction data mainly\\nfocuses on enabling LLMs to follow human instructions,\\nwhich is not always useful for the general language gen-\\neration task.\\n• These small-sized open-source models perform not well on\\nmathematical reasoning, interaction with environment, and tool\\nmanipulation tasks. On the tasks of mathematical reasoning,\\ninteraction with environment and tool manipulation, all\\nthese evaluated open-source models perform not well, in-\\ncluding instruction-tuned ones. A possible reason is that the\\ninstruction data for fine-tuning these models is not specif-\\nically designed for these tasks. In addition, these closed-\\nsource models may have limited model capacities due to\\nsmall model sizes.\\n• The top-performing model varies on different human align-\\nment tasks. For different human alignment tasks, we can see\\nthat these models achieve inconsistent performance rank-\\nings. For example, LLaMA 2-Chat (7B) performs the best\\namong the compared open-source models on TruthfulQA,\\nwhile Vicuna (13B) performs the best on CrowS-Pairs. A\\npossible reason is that these tasks are designed with spe-\\ncific purposes for evaluating different aspects of human\\nalignment, and these models exhibit varied performance\\non different tasks, even for the variants of the same model\\n(e.g., Pythia (7B) and Pythia (12B)). More experiments and\\nanalysis on human alignment evaluation are needed to\\nreveal more detailed findings.\\n• As a more recently released model, LLaMA 2 (7B) overall\\nachieves a good performance, especially on complex reasoning\\ntasks. For complex reasoning tasks, LLaMA 2 (7B) mostly\\nperforms better than other base models, e.g., 43.95 (LLaMA\\n2 (7B)) v.s. 29.80 (Falcon (7B)) in C-Objects. For other'),\n",

Figure 18\\nshows a content organization of this section 48.\\n8.1 LLM for Research Community\\nAs LLMs have revolutionized the way how we develop\\nAI algorithms, it poses significant impact on the research\\ncommunity. In this part, we briefly review the advances that\\nled by LLMs for several representative research directions.\\n8.1.1 LLM for Classic NLP Tasks\\nAs pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT) have originated\\nin the field of NLP , the technical advances of language\\nmodels has an important impact on the research of NLP . In\\nthis part, we discuss the application of LLMs on five kinds\\nof classic NLP tasks, including word-level, sentence-level,\\nsequence tagging, relation extraction, and text generation\\ntasks, which had been the foundation of many existing NLP\\nsystems and applications. Note that we do not intend to\\ncomprehensively cover all NLP tasks, but instead try to\\nanalyze the impact of LLMs for fundamental NLP research\\nthrough the basic tasks. We also omit the discussion of sev-\\neral tasks (e.g., language modeling) that have been discussed\\nearly in this survey.\\nWord/Sentence-level Tasks. As long-standing NLP tasks,\\nword-level ( e.g., word clustering [748] and sense disam-\\nbiguation [749]) and sentence-level tasks (sentence match-\\ning [750] and sentiment classification [751]) have been\\nwidely studied in the literature and applied in real-world\\nplatforms. To solve these tasks, the key is to accurately\\nunderstand the semantic information about the words or\\n48. Note that we don’t aim to cover all the related research directions\\nor domains, but instead demonstrating the use or impact of LLMs via\\nthese selected examples.\\nsentences. As rich high-quality labeled data about these\\ntasks has been accumulated so far, existing work [23, 39]\\nfinds that small language models can achieve very good\\nperformance by fine-tuning on it. Recent studies [55, 752]\\nhave also tested the performance of LLMs on these tasks,\\nshowing that LLMs can also perform well via in-context\\nlearning (with very few examples). Whereas, as small mod-\\nels can be specially optimized on these tasks to learn the\\nspecific task requirement and domain knowledge, full-data\\nfine-tuned small models can mostly outperform LLMs using\\nin-context learning on several classic tasks [753, 754], e.g.,\\nsemantic matching and sentiment analysis.\\nSequence Tagging. The sequence tagging tasks, e.g., named\\nentity recognition (NER) [755] and part-of-speech (POS)\\ntagging [756], are also fundamental tasks. Typically, such\\ntasks require assigning each token in the input sequence a\\nproper semantic category label, e.g., the classic B-I-O ( Be-\\nginning, Inside and Outside) tagging scheme for NER tasks.\\nIn the era of deep learning, early efforts [757, 758] mainly\\nintegrate the learned sequence representations ( e.g., using\\nCNN, LSTM, and BERT) into the classic conditional random\\nfield model (CRF), which performs the tagging task based\\non structural prediction. Recently, researchers have tested\\nthe performance of LLMs in sequence tagging tasks, but ob-\\nserved that LLMs still face challenges in solving them using\\nin-context learning [753], especially for special categories\\nwith ambiguous or rare names, e.g., the “MISC” ( miscella-\\nneous entity ) and “ORG” ( organization) classes. A possible\\nreason is that LLMs may misunderstand the meanings of\\nthese classes in the human-annotated dataset, making it\\ndifficult to accurately understand their semantics according\\nto the instruction and limited examples in the context.\\nInformation Extraction. The information extraction task\\nfocuses on automatically extracting useful structured infor-\\nmation from unstructured text data, such as relation extrac-\\ntion [759] and event extraction [760], which is also a crucial\\ntask relating to many NLP applications. Typically, previous\\nstudies formulate this task as a text classification task or\\na sequential labeling task. As information extraction often\\nneeds to accurately understand and process complex se-\\nmantic relations (multiple relations within one sentence), in-\\ncontext learning with LLMs typically underperform state-\\nof-the-art full-data fine-tuning methods [761, 762]. Whereas,\\nit is shown that enabling collaboration between LLMs and\\nsmall models can further boost the performance of specific\\ntasks [762, 763]. In addition, a recent study [425] also reveals\\nthat LLMs can achieve competitive zero-shot performance\\nfor information extraction with a two-stage workflow, mak-\\ning this approach attractive in future applications.\\nText Generation. Text generation tasks, e.g., machine trans-\\nlation [624] and automatic summarization [548], are long-\\nstanding NLP tasks that have been widely studied, and\\nthere have been a number of deployed products and sys-\\ntems based on fine-tuned small models [311, 764]. Since the\\npre-training of LLMs is established on text prediction, they\\nexhibit strong language generation abilities as commercial\\nproducts [627] and humans [628], with the help of proper\\nprompts [765, 766]. Additionally, LLMs are flexible to effec-\\ntively handle special requirement in real-world application'),\n",

Despite the above\\nsuccess, recent work also reveals that LLMs are hard to well\\naddress the generation tasks about low-resource languages\\nand domains, e.g., Marathi-to-English translation [769], due\\nto their unbalanced training data across different languages.\\nSummary. Based on the above discussion, we summarize\\nthe suggestions, and future direction about the use of LLMs\\nin classic NLP tasks as follows:\\n• Suggestions: LLMs and small models have their own\\nmerits in different aspects: LLMs are can provide unified\\nsolutions to various NLP tasks and achieve competitive\\nperformance (especially in the zero/few-shot setting), while\\nsmall models are economical to develop and can be specially\\ntuned according to target tasks, which can achieve good\\nperformance with sufficient high-quality labeled data [753,\\n754, 770, 771]. In applications, one can make suitable choices\\nbased on the actual needs, comprehensively considering\\nflexibility, data availability, training compute, and efficiency.\\n• Future direction: Despite the excellent general capac-\\nities, LLMs still cannot effectively process the NLP tasks\\nin low-resource domains, e.g., minor language translation.\\nTo tackle such tasks, it needs to develop effective ap-\\nproaches to injecting necessary task information or domain-\\nspecific knowledge into LLMs, either through fine-tuning\\nor prompting. In addition, it is still challenging for LLMs to\\nhandle complex semantic relations in classic NLP tasks (e.g.,\\nnested entity extraction), which is worth more exploration\\nfrom the underlying working mechanism of LLMs. It is also\\npromising to combine LLMs and fine-tuned small language\\nmodels for complementing with each other in solving com-\\nplex cases of classic NLP tasks [772]. Another promising di-\\nrection is to conduct human-machine collaborative research\\n(e.g., conversational translation [768]) on NLP tasks, since\\nLLMs can effectively understand human instructions and\\nmake meaningful responses.\\n8.1.2 LLM for Information Retrieval\\nThe goal of information retrieval (IR) systems is to assist\\nusers in discovering ideal information resources (typically\\ndocuments) and mitigating the information overload issue.\\nTypically, contemporary IR systems adopt a retrieve-then-\\nrerank pipeline framework [54]. Within this framework,\\nthe retriever initially retrieves relevant information from a\\nlarge-scale corpus, and the reranker subsequently performs\\nmulti-stage ranking procedure to acquire the most relevant\\ninformation [773]. Since the advent of LLMs has significant\\nimpact on the way of information access, we discuss how\\nit advances the development of IR from two main aspects,\\nnamely LLMs as IR models and LLM-enhanced IR models.\\nLLMs as IR Models. Existing IR models can be overall\\ncategorized into sparse models (relying on term-based lex-\\nical similarity) and dense models (relying on embedding\\nbased semantic similarity) [740]. Specially, dense models\\nare mainly implemented by fine-tuned PLMs ( e.g., BERT).\\nCompared to PLMs, LLMs have more strong model capac-\\nities in capturing text semantics, thus having the potential\\nto improve existing dense IR models. However, due to the\\nhigh overhead of LLMs, the majority of studies concentrate\\non employing LLMs as rerankers, aiming to refine the rank-\\ning of retrieved candidates. To achieve this, recent efforts\\noften formulate special instructions that enable LLMs to\\nperform reranking on a small set of provided candidate\\ndocuments. Typically, such an approach does not necessitate\\nmodel training, and achieve promising results compared\\nwith well-trained reranking methods [774, 775]. Specially,\\nthe LLM-based reranking approach can be implemented\\nin different ways by zero-shot or few-shot instruction, in-\\ncluding pointwise ( estimating the relevance scores for query-\\ndocument pairs) [776], pairwise (determining the relevance order'),\n",

The essence of these methods lies\\nin the special design of instructions for text reranking, such\\nas sliding window strategy for document lists [774, 778],\\nsetwise selection prompting [779], fine-grained relevance la-\\nbels incorporation [780], and pairwise comparison prompt-\\ning [775]. In addition, recent efforts employ LLMs to gen-\\nerate intermediate texts ( e.g., URLs) as retrieval results us-\\ning few-shot demonstrations [781]. To further enhance the\\nmodel performance, LLMs can be specially fine-tuned as\\nbackbones for reranking [782, 783] or retrieval (including\\ndense retrieval [54] and model-based retrieval [784, 785]),\\nsimilar to the fine-tuning process for traditional PLM-based\\nIR models [782]. However, fine-tuning LLMs as IR models\\nentails considerable expenses given the huge parameter\\nscale of LLMs.\\nLLM-Enhanced IR Models. As another major research\\ndirection, LLMs can be employed to improve existing IR\\nmodels ( e.g., small models). A common challenge faced\\nby existing IR models is the lack of relevant judgment\\nannotation [786, 787]. To tackle this problem, LLMs can be\\ninstructed to annotate positive or negative documents for\\na given query [788], or to generate corresponding queries\\nbased on a set of documents in the corpus by referring to a\\nfew demonstrations [789, 790]. In addition to training data\\naugmentation, LLM has the potential to improve existing\\nIR models by refining the search-oriented informativeness\\nof both queries and documents. In IR systems, the in-\\nput queries may be constrained by a user’s cognitive and\\ncultural competency, making it challenging to accurately\\nexpress the real intent, and irrelevant content present in\\ndocuments can also impact the relevance evaluation with\\nthe query. As a solution, LLM can be utilized to rewrite the\\nquery for enhancing the understanding of the query intent\\nand incorporating additional knowledge into the query\\nthrough well-designed instructions. The rewritten query\\ncan take the form of an improved version of the original\\nquery [791], a document in the corpus that related to the\\nquery [792], or an expansion of the query that concatenated\\nwith a pseudo generated document [793]. In addition, docu-\\nments can also be expanded with queries that are generated\\nbased on the original documents using LLMs for context\\nextension [794].\\nRemaining Issues. In this part, we further discuss several\\nimportant issues to apply LLMs to improve IR systems.\\nFirst, though LLMs are capable of being as general-purpose\\ntask solvers, they are not directly well suited for existing\\nIR systems: they require high overhead for inference [774,\\n782], have limitations in modeling long texts or document\\nlists [778], and need special adaptation ( e.g., instruction\\ntuning) to perform the text ranking task [795]. Therefore,\\nmore systematic approaches to adapt LLMs for modern IR\\nsystems should be investigated, to leverage their benefits\\nand meanwhile overcome these limitations. Secondly, the\\nadvent of LLMs sheds lights on the development of new\\ninformation seeking ways ( e.g., New Bing). It is meaningful\\nto explore how to reshape the architecture and paradigm\\nof IR by integrating the LLMs’ capacities and the merits\\nof existing IR systems [796]. Thirdly, existing work mainly\\nfocuses on text retrieval tasks, lacking a comprehensive\\nconsideration of multimodal information sources. As will\\nbe discussed in Section 8.1.4, multimodal large language\\nmodels [797] are also widely studied, making it feasible to\\ndevelop more powerful multimedia retrieval systems.\\n8.1.3 LLM for Recommender Systems\\nUnlike IR systems that analyze user search queries to\\nretrieve relevant documents, recommender systems (RS)\\naim to capture the underlying user preference and pro-\\nvide appropriate information resources to users [798–801].\\nTypically, existing studies train a recommendation model\\n(either classic or deep learning model) by fitting it over\\nthe user’s logged data ( e.g., click data) [745, 802]. However,\\nthese models often suffer from a series of technical issues,\\ne.g., cold-start recommendation, domain transfer, and poor\\nexplainability. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated the po-\\ntential to alleviate these issues of recommendation mod-\\nels [357, 803, 804], due to the strong capacities of domain\\ngeneralization and language generation. In this part, we\\nbriefly review the recent progress of LLMs in recommender\\nsystems, from the following three aspects, namely LLMs as\\nrecommendation models, LLM-enhanced recommendation\\nmodels, and LLMs as recommendation simulators.\\nLLMs as Recommendation Models. With specific methods\\nor mechanisms, LLMs can be adapted to serve as recom-\\nmendation models. Existing work along this line can be\\ngenerally divided into two main categories. First, some\\nmethods prompt LLMs for completing the recommendation\\ntask in a zero-shot paradigm ( i.e., without parameter tun-\\ning) [805, 806]. A series of prompt engineering methods like\\nrecency-focused and in-context learning are introduced to\\nimprove recommendation performance as well as alleviate\\nthe potential model biases [807, 808]. Second, another cat-\\negory of studies aim to specialize LLMs for personalized\\nrecommendation through instruction tuning [357, 809]. Spe-\\ncially, high-quality instruction data is key to adapt LLMs\\nto the recommendation tasks, which can be constructed\\nbased on user-item interactions with heuristic templates. To\\nfurther improve the instruction diversity, InstructRec [357]\\nemploys self-instruct technique to simulate large amounts of\\npotential user instructions in various scenarios like product\\nsearch and personalized recommendations. In addition to\\nrepresenting each item by its text description, there is also\\ngrowing attention on extending LLM’s vocabulary with\\nsemantic identifiers in recommender systems [810, 811], to\\nincorporate collaborative semantics into LLMs.\\nLLM-enhanced Recommendation Models. In addition to\\ninstructing LLMs to directly provide recommendations, re-\\nsearchers also propose leveraging the universal knowledge\\nencoded in LLMs to improve traditional recommender sys-\\ntems. Existing approaches in this line can be divided into\\nthree main categories. The first category employs LLMs to\\ninfer users’ potential intention from their historical interac-\\ntion data. Furthermore, traditional recommendation/search\\nmodels employ the inferred intentions to improve the re-\\ntrieval of relevant items [812, 813].

As an-\\nother alternative approach, several studies [816, 817] adopt\\na distillation-like way to transfer LLM’s capacities ( e.g.,\\nsemantic encoding) to improve traditional recommenders\\n(i.e., small models). Specially, they align the hidden states\\nof LLMs and traditional recommendation models via joint\\ntraining. After training, since only the enhanced small\\nmodel will be deployed online, it can avoid the huge over-\\nhead of LLMs in online service.\\nLLM as Recommendation Simulator. Inspired by the recent\\nsuccess of autonomous AI agents [818], LLMs have been\\nalso utilized to develop recommendation simulators [819,\\n820] (exemplified by RecAgent [819]), showing great po-\\ntential to simulate user real behaviors in recommender\\nsystems [819, 821, 822]. Specifically, to make personalized\\nsimulation, an agent will be equipped with a profiling\\nmodule that encompasses relevant identity information.\\nThen, a memory module is introduced to store agents’ past\\ninteraction experiences. During the process of simulation,\\nagents are further prompted to conduct self-reflection based\\non their past experiences, to capture their underlying user\\npreference. Most of existing recommendation simulators are\\nconducted in a user-oriented way, without explicitly mod-\\neling the items in the interaction process. To address this,\\nAgentCF [821] models both users and items as agents, and\\nfurther facilitates collaborative reflections to simulate user-\\nitem interactions, so as to capturing the two-sided relations\\nbetween users and items.\\nRemaining Issues. Despite these efforts, there are still\\nseveral challenges to address when applying LLMs in\\nrecommender systems. First, existing studies have shown\\nthat LLM-based recommendation models in zero/few-shot\\nsettings tend to perform worse than traditional ID-based\\nrecommenders [806, 807]. This indicates that LLMs might\\nlack an understanding of personalized user behaviors and\\ndomain-specific collaborative semantics. Although instruc-\\ntion tuning alleviates this issue to some extent [357, 809],\\nit can’t fully reduce the semantic gap between LLMs and\\nrecommender systems, and also suffers from high tuning\\ncosts. Furthermore, recommender systems prioritize min-\\nimizing inference latency to enhance users’ experience in\\nlow-resourced environments ( e.g., phones), which poses a\\nchallenge to LLMs’ inference speed as well as memory\\noverhead. Therefore, it is important to explore improvement\\ntechniques, such as efficient tuning and quantization meth-\\nods, to deploy LLMs efficiently and effectively in real-world\\nrecommender systems. In addition, existing LLMs have\\nlimited capacities in long context modeling, make it difficult\\nto process the huge amount of user-item interaction data.\\nImproved context length extension and context information\\nutilization approaches should be developed to improve the\\nmodeling capacities of LLMs in long interaction sequences.\\n8.1.4 Multimodal Large Language Model\\nIn existing literature [823, 824], multimodal models mainly\\nrefer to the models that can process and integrate informa-\\ntion of various modalities (e.g., text, image, and audio) from\\ninput, and further produce corresponding output in certain\\nmodalities. In this part, we mainly focus on the multimodal\\nextension of LLMs by enabling the information modeling\\nof non-textual modalities, especially the vision modality,\\ncalled multimodal large language models (MLLMs) [797]49. To\\nstart our discussion, we specify the input to be text-image\\npairs and the output to be text responses. Similar discus-\\nsions can be made for other modalities, e.g., language-audio\\nmodels [825], which is beyond our scope here. In essence,\\nMLLMs are developed by adapting the information from\\nother modalities to the text modality, so as to leverage the\\nexcellent model capacities of LLMs that are learned based on\\nworld text. Typically, a MLLM comprises an image encoder\\nfor image encoding and a LLM for text generation, associ-\\nated by a connection module that aligns vision and language\\nrepresentations. During generation, the image is first split\\ninto patches, and then transformed into patch embeddings\\nby the image encoder and the connection module, to derive\\na visual representation that can be understood by the LLM.\\nSubsequently, the patch embeddings and text embeddings\\nare concatenated, and fed into the MLLM, allowing the\\nlanguage model to generate the response autoregressively.\\nIn the following, we will discuss the training, evaluation,\\nand key points to develop capable MLLMs.\\nTraining Process. The training process of the MLLM in-\\ncludes two major stages: vision-language alignment pre-\\ntraining and visual instruction tuning.\\n• Vision-language alignment pre-training. To develop\\nMLLMs, existing work mostly initializes the vision encoder\\nand the LLM with pre-trained models [149, 150, 826]. These\\nmodels retain excellent vision and language capacities, but\\nspan different semantic spaces. Thus, the goal of vision-\\nlanguage alignment pre-training (i.e., the first-stage training)\\nis to align the vision encoder and the LLM through end-to-\\nend training on large-scale image-text pairs [827, 828]. How-\\never, directly tuning these two models on image-text pairs\\nmay cause the degradation of the original representation ca-\\npacities. To improve the alignment performance, it is crucial\\nto design effective training strategies and select appropriate\\npre-training data [829, 830]. Existing work mainly employs\\nthe following strategies for cross-modality alignment: (1) if\\nthe number of image-text pairs is not sufficiently large ( e.g.,\\nless than 1M), it is often suggested to only update the\\nconnection module [831]; (2) if the training data includes\\nhigh-quality text corpora [832] or image-text pairs with\\nfine-grained annotations [833], fine-tuning the LLM can be\\nconducted to boost the performance; (3) if the number of\\nimage-text pairs is very large ( e.g., about 1B), fine-tuning\\nthe vision encoder is also plausible [829, 830], but the benefit\\nremains further verification.\\n• Visual instruction tuning. After vision-language pre-\\ntraining, the second-stage training, i.e., visual instruction\\ntuning, aims to improve the instruction-following and task-\\nsolving abilities of MLLMs. Generally, the input of vi-\\nsual instruction tuning consists of an image and a task\\ndescription, and the task is to generate a corresponding\\n49. In existing work, large vision language models (LVLMs) [662] are\\nalso used to term such bimodal models that are developed based on\\nLLMs. We use the naming of MLLMs in this part due to its wide use in\\nexisting literature.'),\n",

To boost the performance, high-quality visual\\ninstruction data is key to eliciting and enhancing the abil-\\nities of MLLMs. Therefore, most studies are dedicated to\\nconstructing various visual instruction datasets. As the basic\\napproaches, early studies construct visual instructions by\\ndistilling from GPT-4 [149] or reformulating vision-language\\ntask datasets [151]. To enhance the quality of instruction\\ndata, recent work further proposes improved strategies by\\nincreasing the instruction diversity [834], incorporating fine-\\ngrained information ( e.g., coordinate of objects) into the\\ninstruction [833], or synthesizing complex visual reasoning\\ninstructions [835].\\nEvaluation of MLLM. After introducing the approaches to\\ndeveloping MLLMs, we further discuss how to effectively\\nassess the multimodal capabilities of MLLMs from the fol-\\nlowing three aspects.\\n• Evaluation perspectives. The evaluation tasks for MLLMs\\ncan be categorized into two main types: perception and\\ncognition tasks. Specifically, perception tasks aim to assess the\\nmodel’s abilities in understanding the basic semantics of the\\nimage content, while cognition tasks evaluate models with\\nmore complex tasks that require reasoning based on per-\\nception results. The perception ability is typically evaluated\\nthrough classification tasks about attributes of image ( e.g.,\\ntopic and style) and object (e.g., existence and color) or OCR-\\nrelated tasks, based on existing datasets or new datasets\\nderived from existing images with annotations by humans\\nor LLMs [836–839]. A notable perception issue is hallucina-\\ntion [840], where the model’s responses contain inconsistent\\ncontent with the image. Among existing studies about hallu-\\ncination in MLLMs [834, 841, 842], object hallucination [843]\\nhas received much research attention. To conduct a stable,\\nrobust evaluation of object hallucination, POPE [844] pro-\\nposes a polling-based object probing approach for convert-\\ning object recognition into a series of binary questions, and\\nthe results indicate that current MLLMs often struggle with\\nobject hallucination. Cognition tasks, on the other hand, re-\\nquire MLLMs to perform reasoning based on image percep-\\ntion. A common reasoning task is visual question answering\\n(VQA), where models answer questions about images that\\ndemand reasoning about spatial relationships [845], general\\nknowledge [846], or scene text [847]. To fully explore the\\ncapabilities of MLLMs, HallusionBench [848] collects 200\\nsophisticated visual dependent or supplement questions, on\\nwhich even the most advanced MLLMs like LLaVA-1.5 [831]\\nand GPT-4V [133] fail to achieve good performance.\\n• Evaluation paradigms. The responses of MLLMs can\\nbe evaluated either in a closed-ended or an open-ended\\nmanner. Traditional multimodal tasks often rely on a closed-\\nended evaluation framework, where the assessment is based\\non the exact match between the model’s response and the\\nground-truth answer. Examples include the VQA score [849]\\nfor visual question answering tasks and the CIDEr [850]\\nscore for captioning tasks. However, MLLMs generate re-\\nsponses in an open-ended way, which may contain the\\ncorrect answer but not exactly match the ground-truth per-\\nfectly. This discrepancy can lead to the underestimation of\\nthe model’s performance in previous evaluation paradigms.\\nTo address this issue, recent approaches have incorporated\\nhumans or LLMs as evaluators [829]. For instance, MM-\\nBench [838] employs ChatGPT to align the model responses\\nwith the most relevant option in a set of multiple-choice\\nquestions. Similarly, LLaVA [851] utilizes GPT-4 for eval-\\nuating MLLMs’ output, where GPT-4 takes the generated\\nimage captions and object bounding boxes as visual inputs\\nfor assessment. Such open-ended evaluation methods can\\nimprove assessment accuracy while incurring higher costs\\ndue to the involvement of humans or LLMs.\\n• Evaluation benchmarks. To facilitate a more thorough\\nevaluation of MLLMs, various benchmarks have been devel-\\noped. Part of them collect existing vision-language tasks for\\ncomprehensive evaluation. For instance, LVLM-eHub [852]\\naggregates 47 existing text-related visual tasks to assess\\nsix distinct capabilities of MLLMs, and Reform-Eval [853]\\ntakes this a step further by standardizing questions from\\nexisting benchmarks into a uniform format and discusses\\nhow the backbone models influence MLLMs’ performance.\\nIn addition to incorporating existing tasks, several work\\nalso derives new questions annotated by humans or with\\nthe help of LLMs. MME [839] creates a dataset by pair-\\ning images from public sources with manually-collected\\ntext instructions for perception and cognition evaluations.\\nMMBench [838] transforms these instructions into multiple-\\nchoice questions and introduces CircularEval to ensure\\nevaluation consistency. SEED-Bench [854] further considers\\ntemporal understanding tasks and enlarges the evaluation\\nscale to 19K multiple-choice questions with the assistance of\\nLLMs. MM-Vet [855] presents more complex tasks to assess\\nthe integrated multimodal capabilities of MLLMs. It starts\\nby defining six essential multimodal abilities and then cre-\\nates intricate questions by combining multiple abilities. In\\nsummary, the above benchmarks collectively contribute to\\nthe comprehensive evaluation and improved development\\nof MLLMs.\\nKey Points for Improving MLLMs. To develop capable\\nMLLMs, we continue to discuss three key points to improve\\nthe model capacities, from the perspectives of instruction\\ndata, training strategy, and safety and alignment.\\n• Visual instruction data . Extensive work [831, 856] has\\nempirically found that both quantity and quality of visual\\ninstructions have an important impact on model perfor-\\nmance of MLLMs. One basic way to construct visual in-\\nstructions is to leverage the exceptional capability of LLMs\\nto synthesize instructions based on text descriptions of\\nimages [851]. To further enhance the quality of instructions,\\none can construct fine-grained visual instructions with the\\nhelp of human annotation [833, 857] or synthesize more\\ncomplex data through carefully-designed prompts [835].\\nDespite the effectiveness of the above LLM-based ap-\\nproaches, one primary question emerges as to whether a\\nLLM ( i.e., text generation model without training on any\\nimages) possesses the ability to generate sufficiently good\\nvisual instructions solely based on verbalized visual infor-\\nmation ( e.g., captions and coordinates). Specially, existing\\nwork has also revealed that visual instructions generated\\nby LLMs sometimes contain misinterpretations about the\\nvisual information, e.g., object hallucination [844]. Therefore,\\nit is crucial to design effective verification methods to con-\\ntrol the quality of instruction data generated by LLMs [835].\\nFurthermore, it still needs more investigation about what'),\n",

Different from LLMs, MLLMs are not\\ntrained from scratch, but instead developed based on pre-\\ntrained language and vision models. Existing work em-\\nploys a typical two-stage approach for training MLLMs,\\ni.e., vision-language alignment pre-training and visual in-\\nstruction tuning. In essence, existing MLLMs aim to (1) pre-\\nserve the inherent capabilities and parametric knowledge\\nof LLMs as possible, and meanwhile (2) effectively adapt\\nto multimodal tasks by leveraging the pre-trained LLMs\\nand visual encoders. To achieve the above two goals, two\\ntypical training strategies are often employed for visual\\ninstruction tuning, either only optimizing the connection\\nmodule [151] or fine-tuning both the connector module\\nand LLM component [851]. As we can see, the former\\ncan reserve the original capacities of LLMs but likely have\\na weak an adaptation performance, while the latter can\\nfully adapt to multimodal tasks but suffer from the loss of\\noriginal capacities of LLMs. More efforts should be made to\\ninvestigate how to effectively balance the two aspects, so as\\nto achieving improved multimodal capacities. In addition,\\nexisting MLLMs are still overly dependent on the capacities\\nof LLMs, which pose the limits on many multimodal tasks\\n(e.g., space positioning). It will be meaningful to explore\\nimproved training approaches of language models, so that\\nmultimodal information can be also utilized in this process.\\n• Safety and alignment. Safety and alignment has been\\nwidely discussed in LLMs, which aim to regulate the behav-\\niors of models by technical approaches [66]. This topic is also\\nimportant to MLLMs. Even a highly advanced MLLM ( e.g.,\\nGPT-4V [133]) can be susceptible to safety issues. For exam-\\nple, GPT-4V might occasionally exhibit factual inaccuracies\\nand baseless inferences about images. In some cases, it may\\neven generate harmful content targeting specific individuals\\nor groups [133]. Furthermore, open-sourced MLLMs are\\nalso prone to generate hallucinated response [844] and can\\nbe easily manipulated to produce harmful content [858].\\nTo address the aforementioned issues, some studies collect\\nspecialized visual instructions to mitigate the problem of\\nhallucination [834]. Another alternative approach is to train\\na revision model to rectify hallucinated response generated\\nby MLLMs in a post-hoc way [859]. Additionally, aligning\\nMLLMs with RLHF can also assist MLLMs in generating\\nresponses with improved factuality [860]. Despite these\\nefforts, existing alignment techniques for MLLMs mainly\\nconcentrate on several specific aspects ( e.g., hallucination),\\nlacking a comprehensive consideration of alignment criteria.\\nMore efforts should be made to promote the research of\\nsafety and alignment for MLLMs.\\n8.1.5 KG-Enhanced LLM\\nDespite the excellent capacities, LLMs often suffer from\\nchallenges on knowledge-intensive tasks, such as the po-\\ntential to generate hallucinated content [602] and the lack of\\ndomain-specific knowledge [861]. As a promising solution,\\nknowledge graphs (KGs), which store enormous knowledge\\nin the triple format,i.e., ⟨ head entity, relation, tail entity ⟩, can\\nbe utilized to enhance the task performance of LLMs by pro-\\nviding precise and necessary knowledge. Generally, knowl-\\nedge enhanced approaches can be expanded into other\\nforms of structured data ( e.g., tables and databases) [862],\\nwhile we limit our discussion to the integration of KG for\\nimproving LLMs, which are detailed in two aspects, namely\\nretrieval-augmented LLM and synergy-augmented LLM.\\nRetrieval-Augmented LLM. Due to the huge amount of\\nfact records in a KG, existing work typically adopts a\\nretrieval model to first obtain a relatively small subgraph\\nfrom KG, and then leverages it to enhance LLMs by en-\\nriching the relevant knowledge. Before the advent of LLMs,\\nthe retrieved subgraphs are often supplemented into train-\\ning data, injecting knowledge information into PLMs via\\nparameter learning [863–865]. In contrast, to leverage the\\nretrieved knowledge, LLMs mainly incorporate it as part of\\nthe prompt, without parameter update. To implement this\\napproach, there are two main technical problems, i.e., how\\nto retrieve relevant knowledge from KGs and how to make\\nbetter use of the structured data by LLMs. For the first issue\\n(i.e., retrieving relevant knowledge), a typical approach is\\nto train a small language model ( e.g., RoBERTa) to iden-\\ntify question-related fact triples [866]. To further improve\\nthe retrieval performance, several studies also propose an\\niterative reading-then-reasoning framework, enabling the\\nLLM to interact with the KG multiple times and acquire the\\nrequired knowledge in a more accurate way [458]. For the\\nsecond issue (i.e., utilizing retrieved knowledge), a straight-\\nforward approach is to serialize the retrieved subgraph\\nand craft specific prompts to include it as the input of\\nLLMs [471, 651]. However, due to the loss of structured\\ninformation in knowledge serialization, LLMs cannot fully\\ncapture the structural semantics conveyed by original KGs.\\nTo address this issue, several model-based approaches train\\na specialized language model ( e.g., T5) to transform the\\nsubgraph into the natural language text [867]. To guarantee\\nthe transformation accuracy, it relies on sufficient training\\npairs (often unsupervised constructed) [868] and excellent\\nmodel capability [869].\\nSynergy-Augmented LLM. To solve complex tasks ( e.g.,\\nmulti-hop question answering [656]), it often requires LLMs\\nto query a KG multiple times, following a systematic solu-\\ntion plan. We call such a multi-turn interaction approach to\\nenhancing LLM synergy-augmented LLM. To better synergize\\nthe LLM and KG in a complementary manner, recent studies\\npropose to decompose the complex task into multiple sub-\\ngoals and iteratively solve each one by leveraging the nec-\\nessary knowledge from KG [458, 870, 871]. In this process,\\nthe LLM can be regarded as an autonomous agent (detailed\\nin Section 8.1.6), which automatically generates the plan\\nand executes it through interaction with the KG environ-\\nment [870]. Specially, the mainstream approaches typically\\nstart by enumerating the candidates using the available\\nknowledge information at the current step, and then retrieve\\nthe most appropriate candidates for the next step according\\nto the question [870, 871]. By iterating the above two steps,\\nLLMs can gradually collect relevant evidence [870, 871], and\\nfinally approach the correct solution. Despite the effective-\\nness, enumeration of the candidates over the KG would lead\\nto a vast search space [872]. To address it, StructGPT [458]\\nproposes a more efficient way to access knowledge infor-\\nmation using the specialized interfaces for KGs. Specifically,'),\n",

In this way, LLMs can be instructed to better\\nmanipulate and process the structural information of KGs,\\nthus achieving improved task performance.\\nFuture Directions. Besides the above approaches, there\\nare several promising directions for KG-enhanced LLM\\nremaining underexplored. First, due to the variety of struc-\\ntured data, it is still difficult for LLMs to directly leverage\\nvarious kinds of knowledge sources, e.g., domain-specific\\nKGs. Therefore, it is essential to explore the unified way\\nto manipulate and utilize different knowledge sources by\\nLLMs. As a potential solution, it is promising to develop\\neffective approaches to help LLMs comprehend and make\\nuse of the access interfaces provided by specific knowledge\\nsources to acquire precise knowledge [458], while more ef-\\nforts should be made to investigate how to adapt to the data\\nvariety in a cost-effective way. Second, with the evolution of\\nreal-world information, the knowledge stored in LLMs may\\nbecome outdated or incorrect. It is necessary to explore how\\nto synchronize the updated knowledge into LLMs through\\na cost-effective manner [873, 874]. Third, it is promising to\\ninvestigate the use of factual information from KG to align\\nLLMs in generating more faithful content [875, 876], which\\ncan help reduce the hallucination of LLMs.\\nIn addition to exploring KG-enhanced LLMs, it is also\\nmeaningful to leverage LLMs to improve the tasks on the\\nKG side (i.e., LLM4KG) [861, 877]. A typical example is that\\nLLMs can help supplement or construct the KG. We omit\\nthe discussion of this part, since it is beyond our scope.\\n8.1.6 LLM-based Agent\\nThe research on agents in AI aims to develop entities that\\ncan perceive the environment, make decisions, and take\\nactions to achieve specific goals [878]. However, traditional\\nagents are often limited to heuristic rules or specific environ-\\nments, which constrain their generalization to open-domain\\nscenarios [879]. Given that LLMs possess excellent capacities\\nin solving complex tasks, they have rapidly emerged as\\npromising solutions for serving as the core computation\\nunit of agents [818]. In this part, we will first introduce\\nthe framework for LLM-based agents and then discuss their\\napplications.\\nOverall Framework. Next, we first detail the key compo-\\nnents of an LLM-based agent and then present the typical\\nworkflow.\\n• Components. Typically, there are three main com-\\nponents in an LLM-based agent: memory, planning50, and\\nexecution. Specifically, the memory component aims to store\\nthe information perceived from the environment and can\\nbe utilized to support decision-making. In particular, LLM-\\nbased agents usually maintain information in both short-\\nterm memory and long-term memory with the operations\\nof reading and writing. Short-term memory usually refers\\nto the internal context window of LLMs ( i.e., input), where\\n50. Section 6.4 introduces planning as a utilization approach for\\nLLMs, while in this section, we describe its utilization as a functional\\ncomponent in LLM-based agents.\\nLLMs can read and write through actions like reason-\\ning [880]. While long-term memory can be mapped to the\\nexternal storage like vector databases [537], where LLMs\\ncan read through retrieval and write with reflection [686].\\nSpecially, profiles are usually implemented with long-term\\nmemory, which is an important feature for an agent that\\nspecifies its role and function [818]. The planning component\\nis responsible for generating the action plan based on the in-\\nformation from the memory component. In data format, the\\nplan usually takes the form of text-based instructions [441]\\nor code-based programs [443]. To generate it, LLM-based\\nagents will first propose several candidates and then select\\na more suitable one among them [436]. The initial plan\\ncan be further refined with execution feedback from the\\nenvironment [528]. The execution component is in charge\\nof carrying out the plan from the planning component,\\nwhich can be fulfilled by the internal LLM [441] or external\\ntools [880].\\n• Workflow. With the three components mentioned\\nabove, a typical workflow of an LLM-based agent is as\\nfollows. First, it receives information from the environment\\nand writes it into short-term memory. Then, the agent\\nprocesses the newly received information in the short-term\\nmemory. Such a process can be enhanced with information\\nretrieved from long-term memory. Subsequently, the plan-\\nning component utilizes the processed information from\\nshort-term memory to generate the next plan. Finally, the\\nexecution component carries out the plan generated from\\nthe planning component, which can be further assisted with\\nexternal tools. By repeating the aforementioned process, the\\nLLM-based agent can autonomously adjust its behavior in\\nresponse to feedback from the environment and ultimately\\nachieve its goal. Once LLM-based agents receive user re-\\nquests or are assigned goals, they follow the above work-\\nflow to accomplish tasks through multi-turn interactions\\nwith the environment.\\nTo summarize, in an LLM-based agent, the LLM serves\\nas the core computation unit and is equipped with compo-\\nnents including memory, planning, and execution. These com-\\nponents are integrated in a systematic way under the control\\nof the LLM during interactions with the environment. For\\nmore details, the readers might refer to the comprehensive\\nsurvey for LLM-based AI agents [818].\\nApplications. Recently, LLM-based agents have shown\\ngreat potential in autonomously solving complex tasks,\\nmaking it feasible to rapidly develop capable applications\\nfor specific domains or tasks. In this section, we will discuss\\nthe applications in single-agent and multi-agent scenarios.\\n• Single-agent based applications. Applications based on\\na single-agent mode mainly aim to develop capable task\\nsolvers that can autonomously complete user requests. A\\nlarge number of single-agent projects have been developed,\\nwhich focus on general-purpose task solving. As a rep-\\nresentative project, AutoGPT [534] empowers LLMs with\\nlong/short-term memory management and external tools\\nlike search engines. In order to autonomously address a\\nuser request, AutoGPT understands the request with knowl-\\nedge from its memory and actions like reasoning, decom-\\nposes it into a detailed plan, executes the plan step-by-\\nstep with the assistance of tools, and refines the rest plan'),\n",

Different from single-\\nagent systems where agents work independently, multi-\\nagent systems work in collaboration to unleash collective\\nintelligence. Typically, multiple agents can be instantiated\\nfrom the same or different LLMs, each with their respective\\nroles and functions. According to the coordinating strategies\\namong these agents, multi-agent systems can be divided\\ninto two categories: cooperation-based and competition-\\nbased. In the cooperation-based mode, to share information\\nand seek collaborative actions among agents, various com-\\nmunication protocols have been proposed, including free-\\nform dialogue [883], structured document [884], and data\\nembedding [885]. Based on the communication protocol,\\nagents can be effectively organized for downstream appli-\\ncations, such as software engineering [884], user behavior\\nanalysis [819, 821], and society simulation [533]. In the\\ncompetition-based mode, debate serves as one of the pop-\\nular communication protocols to foster divergent thinking\\nand elicit valuable external feedback among agents. Such a\\nway is beneficial for domains that demand precise decision-\\nmaking and accurate responses, such as mathematical rea-\\nsoning [886] and evaluation [732].\\nRemaining Issues. Despite the huge success, there are still\\nseveral issues that limit the development and applications\\nof LLM-based agents. First, with the explosive growth of the\\nmodel scale, the efficiency of LLM-based agents, including\\nboth the time and memory overhead, becomes an important\\nissue for large-scale deployment, especially for multi-agent\\nsystems with numerous instances of LLMs. Second, with the\\nscaling of the number of LLM-based agents, more effective\\nand efficient communication protocols and architectures are\\nrequired to support the increased complexity of coordina-\\ntion among agents. Furthermore, building capable agents\\nposes technical challenges for the capacities of LLMs like\\ninstruction following and long text modeling. Since existing\\nLLMs are not specially optimized for instantiating agents,\\nmost public-sourced LLMs like LLaMA cannot effectively\\nfacilitate the development of agents. Therefore, it is crucial\\nto develop capable, specialized models to serve as the core\\ncomputation unit of agents.\\n8.1.7 LLM for Evaluation\\nWhile human evaluation can generally offer reliable quality\\nassessment, it is also often hindered by high annotation\\ncosts, significant time requirements, and annotation incon-\\nsistencies [887]. In contrast, automatic evaluation can be\\nemployed as a scalable alternative to human evaluation.\\nTraditional automatic evaluations have relied on reference-\\nbased metrics ( e.g., BLEU and ROUGE). Recently, with\\nthe emergence of LLMs as general task solvers highlights\\ntheir potential as automatic evaluators [647, 727], making it\\npromising to conduct LLM based evaluation. In the follow-\\ning part, we will introduce the recent progress on LLM for\\nevaluation, including evaluation formats, methods, meta-\\nevaluation, and the remaining issues.\\nEvaluation Formats. Depending on the type of evaluation\\noutcome, the evaluation format can be categorized into\\nscore-based evaluation and language-based evaluation . Score-\\nbased evaluation employs measurable metrics to assign\\nquality scores (e.g., ratings or rankings) for evaluated texts.\\nA prevalent way is to conduct pairwise comparison, where\\nLLMs are used to determine the partial order relation of\\ncandidate texts following specific guidelines [354, 647, 727],\\nwhich greatly simplifies the evaluation task. However, it\\nmay face the inefficiency issue when scaling up the number\\nof candidates [727]. When high-quality reference texts are\\navailable during evaluation, LLMs can be instructed to score\\ntexts under the guidance provided by references [716, 727,\\n728]. On the other hand, language-based evaluation focuses\\non generating critiques and suggestions, offering qualitative\\nexplanation beyond simple quantitative scoring [371, 888–\\n890]. It is particularly useful for gathering language feed-\\nback signals for human alignment tuning [371, 888]. Fur-\\nthermore, it can evolve into a multi-turn interaction frame-\\nwork, where LLM-based evaluators provide natural lan-\\nguage feedback to existing solutions from task solvers [891].\\nThis framework evaluates the ability of LLMs to leverage\\nlanguage feedback for refining self-generated solutions.\\nEvaluation Methods. A common method for LLM-based\\nevaluation involves prompting LLMs with specific instruc-\\ntions. To further improve the quality of LLM-based eval-\\nuation, recent work proposes to prompt LLMs with varied\\ncontexts to generate diverse evaluation feedback. These con-\\ntexts vary in aspects such as the candidate order [647, 727],\\nevaluation perspectives [892, 893] ( e.g., relevance, clarity,\\noriginality), and evaluation explanation [647]. The gener-\\nated multiple evaluation feedbacks are then aggregated to\\nproduce a final evaluation result, which makes the evalua-\\ntion process less prone to biases from individual feedback\\nand allows for a more thorough evaluation by covering\\na wider range of evaluation aspects. To further improve\\nthe quality of the single-model evaluation, recent studies\\nalso develop multi-agent collaboration frameworks [893–\\n895] or fine-tune LLMs as specified evaluators [371, 888–\\n890, 896]. In a multi-model collaboration mode, different\\nLLMs evaluate the candidates by engaging in discussions\\nto align preferences and reach a consensus [894, 895]. This\\nmethod helps reduce the potential biases in individual\\nmodels through the consensus reached by multiple agents.\\nAnother approach to improving single-model evaluation\\nis to specialize LLMs as scores or critics through fine-\\ntuning [371, 888–890, 896]. This process involves creating\\ndatasets annotated with preferences and feedback from\\nhumans or proficient LLMs. These datasets are then used to\\ntrain evaluation-oriented models, enabling them to generate\\npairwise preference or language feedback. The specialized\\nLLM evaluators demonstrate competitive performance with\\nfewer parameters [889, 890, 896].\\nMeta-Evaluation. To effectively assess the quality of\\nLLM-based evaluators, meta-evaluation benchmarks have\\nbeen introduced, for gauging the agreement with human'),\n",

As a representative bench-\\nmark, MT-Bench [727] evaluates the agreement between\\nLLMs and human judgments, demonstrating that GPT-4\\naligns closely with human preferences in no-tie compar-\\nisons on 80 multi-turn questions. In addition, to address\\npotential biases arising from subjective human evaluations,\\nLLMBar [897] manually designs outputs that are objectively\\nworse but superficially appealing, which could mislead\\nevaluators. The evaluation results reveal that even the most\\nadvanced LLMs still fall short of human-level evaluation in\\nthe challenging setting.\\nRemaining Issues. As discussed in Section 7.1.1, recent\\nstudies demonstrate that LLM-based evaluators expose\\nmultiple types of bias, such as order bias, self-preference\\nbias, and length bias [647, 727]. Although some biases can\\nbe mitigated through methods like multi-path ensemble or\\nmulti-agent collaboration, they remain inherent to LLM-\\nbased evaluators. Consequently, addressing these biases\\nintrinsically within the models continues to be an a chal-\\nlenging issue. In addition, recent work has revealed that\\nLLMs may be incapable of understanding the self-generated\\ncontent, exhibiting a weaker understanding capacity com-\\npared to their generation capabilities [899]. Even the most\\nadvanced LLMs still struggle identifying their reasoning or\\nfactual errors without external feedback [900, 901]. Conse-\\nquently, current LLM-based evaluators might not be ade-\\nquate for evaluating top-tier LLMs or complex tasks. This\\nunderscores the importance of improvement approaches\\nfor LLM-based evaluators, especially for evaluating capable\\nLLMs and complex tasks demanding sophisticated reason-\\ning, planning, and domain-specific knowledge.\\n8.2 LLM for Specific Domains\\nIn this part, we discuss the applications of LLMs on several\\nrepresentative domains, including healthcare, education,\\nlaw, finance, and scientific research assistance.\\nHealthcare is a vital application field closely related to\\nhuman life. Ever since the advent of ChatGPT, a number of\\nstudies have applied ChatGPT or other LLMs to the medical\\ndomain. It has been shown that LLMs are capable of han-\\ndling a variety of healthcare tasks, e.g., biology information\\nextraction [763], medical advice consultation [902], mental\\nhealth analysis [903], and report simplification [904]. As\\nthe major technical approach, researchers typically design\\nspecific prompts or instructions to guide LLMs to perform a\\nwide range of medical tasks. To further harness the power\\nof LLMs in the healthcare domain, researchers propose to\\ndevelop healthcare-related LLMs [356, 905, 906]. Specifically,\\nthe Med-PaLM models [356, 905] achieves expert-level per-\\nformance on the United States Medical Licensing Exami-\\nnation (USMLE), and earns greater approval from physi-\\ncians in answering consumer’s medical questions. However,\\nLLMs may fabricate medical misinformation [904, 907],\\ne.g., misinterpreting medical terms and suggesting advice\\ninconsistent with medical guidelines. In addition, it would\\nalso raise privacy concerns to upload the health information\\nof patients [763] into a commercial server that support the\\nLLM.\\nEducation is also an important application domain where\\nLLMs potentially exert significant influence. Existing work\\nhas found that LLMs can achieve student-level performance\\non standardized tests [46] in a variety of subjects of math-\\nematics ( e.g., physics, computer science) on both multiple-\\nchoice and free-response problems. In addition, empirical\\nstudies have shown that LLMs can serve as writing or read-\\ning assistant for education [908, 909]. A recent study [909]\\nreveals that ChatGPT is capable of generating logically\\nconsistent answers across disciplines, balancing both depth\\nand breadth. Another quantitative analysis [908] shows that\\nstudents utilizing ChatGPT (either keeping or refining the\\nresults from LLMs as their own answers) perform better\\nthan average students in some courses from the computer\\nsecurity field. Recently, several perspective papers [910, 911]\\nalso explore various application scenarios of LLMs in class-\\nroom teaching, such as teacher-student collaboration, per-\\nsonalized learning, and assessment automation. However,\\nthe application of LLMs in education may lead to a series\\nof practical issues, e.g., plagiarism, potential bias in AI-\\ngenerated content, overreliance on LLMs, and inequitable\\naccess for non-English speaking individuals [912].\\nLaw is a specialized domain that is built on professional\\ndomain knowledge. Recently, a number of studies have ap-\\nplied LLMs to solve various legal tasks, e.g., legal document\\nanalysis [913], legal judgment prediction [914], and legal\\ndocument writing [915]. A recent study [916] has found\\nthat LLMs exhibit powerful abilities of legal interpretation\\nand reasoning. Moreover, the latest GPT-4 model achieves\\na top 10% score in a simulated bar exam compared with\\nhuman test-takers [46]. To further improve the performance\\nof LLMs in the law domain, specially designed legal prompt\\nengineering are employed to yield advanced performance\\nin long legal document comprehension and complex legal\\nreasoning [917, 918]. To summarize the progress, LLMs can\\nact as helpful assistants to legal profession. Despite the\\nprogress, the use of LLMs in law raises concerns about\\nlegal challenges, including copyright issues [919], personal\\ninformation leakage [920], or bias and discrimination [921].\\nFinance is an important field where LLMs have promis-\\ning application prospects. LLMs have been employed on\\nvarious finance related tasks, such as numerical claim\\ndetection [922], financial sentiment analysis [923], finan-\\ncial named entity recognition [924], and financial reason-\\ning [925]. Despite the competitive zero-shot performance\\nexhibited by general-purpose LLMs in the finance tasks,\\nthey still underperform domain-specific PLMs containing\\nmillion-scale parameters [922]. To leverage the scaling effect\\nof LLMs, researchers collect large-scale finance corpora for\\ncontinually pre-training LLMs ( e.g., BloombergGPT [360],\\nXuanYuan 2.0 [926], and FinGPT [927]). BloombergGPT\\nhas demonstrated remarkable performance across a diverse\\nrange of financial tasks while maintaining competitive per-\\nformance in general-purpose tasks [360]. Nevertheless, it is\\nimperative to consider the potential risks in the application\\nof LLMs in finance, as the generation of inaccurate or\\nharmful content by LLMs could have significant adverse\\nimplications for financial markets [360]. Therefore, it needs\\nmore strict reviewing and monitoring on the use of LLMs in'),\n",

Prior research\\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in handling\\nknowledge-intensive scientific tasks (e.g., PubMedQA [928],\\nBioASQ [929]), especially for LLMs that are trained on\\nscientific-related corpora [35, 203, 930]. Given the excel-\\nlent general abilities and broad scientific knowledge, LLMs\\nhold significant potential as helpful assistants across var-\\nious stages of the scientific research pipeline [931]. First,\\nduring the literature survey stage, LLMs can help conduct\\na comprehensive overview of the progress in a specific\\nresearch field [932, 933]. Second, during the research idea\\ngeneration stage, LLMs demonstrate the ability to generate\\nintriguing scientific hypotheses [934]. Third, during the data\\nanalysis stage, LLMs can be employed to conduct automatic\\napproaches to analyzing the data characteristics, includ-\\ning data exploration, visualization, and deriving analytical\\nconclusions [935, 936]. Fourth, during the paper writing\\nstage, researchers can also benefit from the assistance of\\nLLMs in scientific writing [937, 938], in which LLMs can\\noffer valuable support for scientific writing through diverse\\nmeans, such as summarizing the existing content and pol-\\nishing the writing [939]. In addition, LLMs can aid in\\nthe automated paper review process, encompassing tasks\\nsuch as error detection, checklist verification, and candidate\\nranking [940]. Despite these advances, there is much room\\nfor improving the capacities of LLMs to serve as helpful,\\ntrustworthy scientific assistants, to both increase the quality\\nof the generated scientific content and reduce the harmful\\nhallucinations.\\nSummary. In addition to the aforementioned work, the\\napplications of LLMs have been also discussed in several\\nother domains. For instance, in the psychologic domain,\\nsome recent work has studied the human-like characteristics\\nof LLMs, such as self-awareness, theory of mind (ToM), and\\naffective computing [941, 942]. In particular, an empirical\\nevaluation of ToM conducted on two classic false-belief\\ntasks speculates that LLMs may have ToM-like abilities\\nsince the model in the GPT-3.5 series achieves comparable\\nperformance with nine-year-old children in ToM task [941].\\nIn addition, another line of work has investigated applying\\nLLMs into the software development domain, e.g., code\\nsuggestion [943], code summarization [944], and automated\\nprogram repair [945]. To summarize, to assist humans by\\nLLMs in real-world tasks has become a significant area of\\nresearch. However, it also presents challenges. Ensuring the\\naccuracy of LLM-generated content, addressing biases, and\\nmaintaining user privacy and data security are crucial con-\\nsiderations when applying LLMs to real-world scenarios.\\n9 C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\\nIn this survey, we have reviewed the recent progress of large\\nlanguage models (LLMs), and introduced the key concepts,\\nfindings, and techniques for understanding and utilizing\\nLLMs. We focus on the large-sized models (i.e., having a size\\nlarger than 10B) while excluding the contents of early pre-\\ntrained language models ( e.g., BERT and GPT-2) that have\\nbeen well covered in the existing literature. In particular,\\nour survey has discussed four important aspects of LLMs,\\ni.e., pre-training, adaptation, utilization, and evaluation. For\\neach aspect, we highlight the techniques or findings that are\\nkey to the success of LLMs. Furthermore, we also summa-\\nrize the available resources for developing LLMs and dis-\\ncuss important implementation guidelines for reproducing\\nLLMs. This survey tries to cover the most recent literature\\nabout LLMs and provides a good reference resource on this\\ntopic for both researchers and engineers.\\nNext, we summarize the discussions of this survey, and\\nintroduce the challenges and future directions for LLMs, in\\nthe following aspects.\\nBasics and Principles. Instead of training on specific task\\ngoals, LLMs learn from unsupervised pre-training on large-\\nscale text data. This is quite different from previous multi-\\ntask learning approaches, which aim to extend the training\\ntasks as possible to achieve sufficient generalization. Thus,\\nit is essential to reveal the basic principles or elements that\\nestablish the foundation of the abilities of LLMs. Although\\nthe basic idea of language models is intuitive, it is still chal-\\nlenging to formally explain why LLMs trained by simple\\nlanguage modeling objectives ( e.g., next token prediction)\\ncan become capable of solving various real-world tasks.\\nTo investigate this problem, a promising approach is to\\nstudy the capacity learning (or selection) mechanism based\\non unsupervised pre-training, since the model capacity of\\nLLMs strongly depends on pre-training data. In addition,\\nscaling plays an important role in improving the capacity\\nof LLMs [31, 55, 64], and it is very useful to conduct more\\ntheoretical analysis about how the behaviors of large models\\nrelate to those of small models, e.g., what behaviors of large\\nmodels can be inferred from small models and what can’t be\\npredicted indeed. Another research direction is to explore\\nmore deep analysis on model generalization for LLMs,\\nsince increasing concerns have been raised about whether\\nLLMs can generalize beyond the knowledge encoded by\\npre-training data. Furthermore, data contamination has be-\\ncome a severe issue for fairly assessing the performance of\\nLLMs [738], and thus setting appropriate evaluation proto-\\ncol will be the basis to investigate and analyze the model\\ncapacity of LLMs.\\nModel Architecture. Due to the scalability and effective-\\nness, Transformer has become the de facto architecture\\nfor building LLMs. Various strategies have been proposed\\nto improve the performance of this architecture, such as\\nneural network configuration and scalable parallel training\\n(see discussions in Section 4.2.2). However, Transformer\\nstill suffers from high training costs and slow inference\\nrates. More efforts [251, 252] are still in need to develop\\nimproved model architectures for large-scale pre-training.\\nSpecially, system-level or hardware-level optimization ( e.g.,\\nFlashAttention [284]) is worth more exploration to improve\\nthe efficiency of Transformer architectures. In addition, as an\\nimportant basic capacity, existing LLMs typically maintain\\na long context window. For example, the most recent GPT-4\\nTurbo enables a long context of 128K tokens, and Claude\\n2.1 also supports the input up to 200K tokens. Although\\nmany efforts have been made to enhance the long context\\nmodeling ability of LLMs [264, 291], the resulting mod-'),\n",

To address this issue, specific architecture\\nadaptations or algorithms might be needed to enhance the\\nmodeling and utilization of long context information. An-\\nother worrying concern is that existing work mostly focuses\\non training LLMs with decoder-only Transformers. Despite\\nthe effectiveness, it severely limits the more wide, diverse\\nexplorations on alternative model architectures.\\nModel Training. For pre-training, it is essential to establish\\na data-centric infrastructure and training procedure for LLM\\noptimization, which can effectively support a systematic\\nprocess of data collection, data cleaning, data mixture, and\\ndata curriculum. Furthermore, it also calls for more flexible\\nmechanisms of hardware support or resource schedule, so\\nas to better organize and utilize the resources in a computing\\ncluster. In practice, it is very challenging to pre-train capable\\nLLMs, due to the huge compute consumption and the\\nsensitivity to data quality and training tricks [78, 93]. Thus,\\nit becomes particularly important to develop systemic, eco-\\nnomical pre-training approaches for optimizing LLMs, e.g.,\\npredictable scaling [46] and proxy model training [59]. More\\ntraining recipes or principles should be investigated and\\nshared to reduce the potential risk of degradation or failure\\nin large-scale model optimization. Although increasingly\\nmore model checkpoints and cleaned datasets have been\\nreleased, there still lacks reproducible work on pre-training\\ndata preparation (e.g., detailed cleaning strategies) and data\\nscheduling ( e.g., data mixture and curriculum). Since it is\\nvery costly to pre-train a LLM from scratch, it is important\\nto design suitable mechanisms for continually pre-training\\nor fine-tuning the LLM based on publicly available model\\ncheckpoints ( e.g., LLaMA [57] and Flan-T5 [69]). For this\\npurpose, a number of technical issues have to be resolved,\\ne.g., catastrophic forgetting and task specialization. Further-\\nmore, it is also useful to develop effective tuning strategies\\nthat effectively inject or edit specific knowledge [672], e.g.,\\ncorrecting the outdated facts.\\nModel Utilization. Based on the natural language inter-\\nface, prompting has become the prominent approach for\\nusing LLMs to solving various tasks. By combining task\\ndescriptions and demonstration examples into prompts, in-\\ncontext learning (ICL) endows LLMs with the ability to\\nperform well on new tasks, even outperforming full-data\\nfine-tuned models in some cases. To enhance the ability of\\ncomplex reasoning, advanced prompting techniques have\\nbeen proposed, exemplified by the chain-of-thought (CoT)\\nstrategy, which includes the intermediate reasoning steps\\ninto prompts. Furthermore, planning is a promising ap-\\nproach for solving complex tasks, which iteratively invokes\\nLLMs by leveraging tool use capacities. Despite these ef-\\nforts, several basic problems related to prompting are still\\nunder-explored: why a good prompt can elicit the correct\\nanswer but a bad prompt cannot, how to reveal the working\\nprinciples of advanced prompting methods ( e.g., ICL and\\nCoT) and further improve these existing approaches, and\\nhow to efficiently find the effective prompts for LLMs on\\nspecific tasks. Furthermore, from a practical perspective, it\\nhas become a fundamental challenge to reduce the inference\\ncost of LLMs, especially in large-scale deployment. Another\\npopular research direction is retrieval-augmented gener-\\nation, where retrieved contexts from supporting sources\\nare included into prompts for task solving. It has been\\nshown that retrieval augmentation can extend the knowl-\\nedge boundary and improve the question answering ca-\\npacity [461], but may suffer from the effectiveness of long\\ncontext utilization by LLMs [299].\\nSafety and Alignment. Despite the capacities, LLMs are\\nfaced with great safety challenges in practical use. As a\\nfundamental issue of probabilistic modeling nature, LLMs\\nexhibit a tendency to generate hallucinations [638], refer-\\nring to texts that seem plausible but may be factually\\nincorrect [46]. What is worse, LLMs might be elicited by\\nintentional instructions to produce harmful, biased, or toxic\\ntexts for malicious systems, leading to the potential risks\\nof misuse [55, 66]. To have a detailed discussion of the\\nsafety issues of LLMs ( e.g., privacy, overreliance, disinfor-\\nmation, and influence operations), the readers can refer to\\nthe GPT-3/4 technical reports [46, 55]. As the major tech-\\nnical approach to averting these issues, alignment methods\\n(e.g., RLHF) [66, 116] have been widely used by leveraging\\nhuman feedback for developing well-aligned LLMs. How-\\never, RLHF heavily relies on high-quality human feedback\\ndata from professional labelers, which is costly and time-\\nconsuming to recruit qualified human annotators. There-\\nfore, it is necessary to improve the RLHF framework for\\nreducing the efforts of human labelers and seek a more\\nefficient annotation approach with guaranteed data quality,\\ne.g., LLMs can be employed to assist the labeling work.\\nFurthermore, it is also suggested to develop simplified\\noptimization algorithms for alignment [386, 389], to reduce\\nthe training difficulty and unstability of RLHF. As another\\npractical approach, red teaming [132, 369] has been adopted\\nfor improving the model safety of LLMs, which utilizes\\nthe collected adversarial prompts to refine the LLMs ( i.e.,\\navoiding the attacks from red teaming). In addition, privacy\\nconcerns are also important to consider when fine-tuning\\nLLMs with domain-specific data, and thus federated based\\nlearning [946] can be useful in privacy-restricted scenarios.\\nApplication and Ecosystem. As LLMs have shown strong\\ncapacities in solving various tasks, they can be applied\\nin a broad range of real-world applications ( i.e., following\\ntask-specific natural language instructions). As a remarkable\\nprogress, ChatGPT has potentially changed the way how\\nhumans access information, which has been additionally\\nintegrated in the release of New Bing . Generally, in the\\nnear future, it can be foreseen that LLMs would have a\\nsignificant impact on information-seeking techniques, in-\\ncluding both search engines and recommender systems.\\nFurthermore, LLMs make it possible to develop more intel-\\nligent systems (e.g., autonomous AI agents) to tackle various\\ncomplex tasks in real-world scenarios. Specially, Assistants\\nAPI has been launched by OpenAI (featured by instructions,\\nknowledge and tool use), enabling rapid development of\\nagent-like assistants within the applications. This wave of\\ntechnical innovation would lead to an ecosystem of LLM-\\nempowered applications ( e.g., OpenAI’s GPT Store), which\\nhas a close connection with human life. Lastly, the rise of\\nLLMs sheds light on the exploration of artificial general'),\n",

We will regularly include new content\\ninto this survey, to make it more self-contained and up-\\nto-date. Here, we list several potential topics that might\\nappear in the next major version(s): (1) more experiments\\nwith larger language models for both instruction tuning and\\nability evaluation; (2) more detailed prompting practice; (3)\\ntraining recipe; (4) more theoretical analysis and discussion;\\n(5) more discussions on applications.\\nClarifications on Experiments . In this version, we have\\nincluded a number experiments on instruction-tuning (Ta-\\nble 9), overall ability evaluation (Table 16), and prompt\\nengineering (Table 17). Due to the limit of computational\\nresources, our experiments are not complete, limited to\\nsmall-sized models or a few comparisons. Despite that, we\\nfeel that it might be meaningful to share the partial results to\\nthe public. We will try to include the missing results of larger\\nmodels or more comparisons in the future versions. We also\\ncall for support of computing power for conducting more\\ncomprehensive experiments.\\nChinese Version. We also provide a translated Chinese ver-\\nsion (corresponding to the first release) of this survey paper\\nat the link: https://github.com/RUCAIBox/LLMSurvey/\\nblob/main/assets/LLM Survey Chinese.pdf. Four volun-\\nteers contribute to check and revise the content, and they\\nare Yiwen Hu, Xin Deng, Xinming Hou, Yanbin Yin, and\\nZhanshuo Cao (in order of contribution). We will also con-\\ntinuously update the Chinese version, but it may not be as\\ntimely as the latest English version.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nThe authors would like to thank Yankai Lin and Yutao Zhu\\nfor proofreading this paper.

This attention is a timely re-\\nsponse to the many urgent questions that this tech-\\nnology raises, but it can sometimes miss important\\nconsiderations. This paper surveys the evidence\\nfor eight potentially surprising such points:\\n1. LLMs predictably get more capable with in-\\ncreasing investment, even without targeted\\ninnovation.\\n2. Many important LLM behaviors emerge un-\\npredictably as a byproduct of increasing in-\\nvestment.\\n3. LLMs often appear to learn and use repre-\\nsentations of the outside world.\\n4. There are no reliable techniques for steering\\nthe behavior of LLMs.\\n5. Experts are not yet able to interpret the inner\\nworkings of LLMs.\\n6. Human performance on a task isn’t an upper\\nbound on LLM performance.\\n7. LLMs need not express the values of their\\ncreators nor the values encoded in web text.\\n8. Brief interactions with LLMs are often mis-\\nleading.\\nIntroduction\\nLarge language models (LLMs, e.g. GPT-3, PALM,\\nLLaMA, and GPT-4; Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al.,\\n2022; Touvron et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023b) and products\\nbuilt on them, such as ChatGPT, have recently prompted\\nan enormous amount of attention from journalists, (Klein,\\n2023; Perrigo, 2023; Oliver, 2023), policymakers (J & C,\\n2023; Bartz, 2023; Lieu, 2023), and scholars from many\\n1New York University 2Anthropic, PBC. Correspondence to:\\nSamuel R. Bowman <bowman@nyu.edu>.\\nﬁelds (Chan, 2022; Lund & Wang, 2023; Choi et al., 2023;\\nBiswas, 2023). This technology deﬁes expectations in many\\nways, though, and it can be easy for brief discussions of it\\nto leave out important points.\\nThis paper presents eight potentially surprising claims that\\nI expect will be salient in at least some of the conversa-\\ntions that are springing up around LLMs. They reﬂect, to\\nthe best of my understanding, views that are reasonably\\nwidely shared among the researchers—largely based in pri-\\nvate labs—who have been developing these models. All the\\nevidence I present here, as well as most of the arguments,\\nare collected from prior work, and I encourage anyone who\\nﬁnds these claims useful to consult (and directly cite) the\\nsources named here.\\nI do not mean for these claims to be normative in any signif-\\nicant way. Rather, this work is motivated by the recognition\\nthat deciding what we should do in light of this disruptive\\nnew technology is a question that is best led—in an informed\\nway—by scholars, advocates, and lawmakers from outside\\nthe core technical R&D community.\\n1. LLMs predictably get more capable with\\nincreasing investment, even without\\ntargeted innovation\\nScaling law results (Kaplan et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020;\\nHoffmann et al., 2022) have been a major driving factor\\nin the recent surge of research and investment into LLMs\\n(Ganguli et al., 2022a). Scaling laws allow us to precisely\\npredict some coarse-but-useful measures of how capable\\nfuture models will be as we scale them up along three dimen-\\nsions: the amount of data they are fed, their size (measured\\nin parameters), and the amount of computation used to train\\nthem (measured in FLOPs). These results thereby allow\\nus to make some key design decisions, such as the optimal\\nsize of a model given some ﬁxed resource budget, without\\nextremely expensive trial and error.\\nOur ability to make this kind of precise prediction is un-\\nusual in the history of software and unusual even in the\\nhistory of modern AI research. It is also a powerful tool for\\ndriving investment since it allows R&D teams to propose\\nmodel-training projects costing many millions of dollars,\\nwith reasonable conﬁdence that these projects will succeed\\narXiv:2304.00612v1  [cs.CL]  2 Apr 2023'),\n",

GPT-2 adds the ability to pro-\\nduce text of reasonably high quality, as well as a limited\\nability to follow simple instructions (Radford et al., 2019).\\nGPT-3 is the ﬁrst modern general-purpose LLM, and is prac-\\ntically useful across a wide range of language tasks. The\\ndesigns of these three models hardly differ at all. Instead,\\nthe qualitative differences between them stem from vast\\ndifferences in scale: Training GPT-3 used roughly 20,000×\\nmore computation than training the original GPT (Sevilla\\net al., 2022), as well as signiﬁcantly more data and parame-\\nters. There are substantial innovations that distinguish these\\nthree models, but they are almost entirely restricted to in-\\nfrastructural innovations in high-performance computing\\nrather than model-design work that is speciﬁc to language\\ntechnology.\\nWhile the techniques used to train the newest LLMs are no\\nlonger generally disclosed, the most recent detailed reports\\nsuggest that there have been only slight deviations from\\nthis trend, and that designs of these systems are still largely\\nunchanged (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Hoffmann et al., 2022;\\nTouvron et al., 2023).\\nContinuing to scale these techniques up beyond GPT-3 has\\nproduced further economically valuable returns: The subse-\\nquent GPT-4 model outperforms qualiﬁed humans on many\\ngraduate and professional exams (OpenAI, 2023b), and its\\ndevelopment helped prompt a multi-billion-dollar invest-\\nment in the company that built it (Capoot, 2023). Scaling\\nlaws allowed the creators of GPT-4 to cheaply and accu-\\nrately predict a key overall measure of its performance:\\nThis forecast was made by ﬁtting a statistical trend in the\\nperformance of small models, which collectively took about\\n0.1% of the resources needed by the ﬁnal model, and then\\nextrapolating out that trend (see Figure 1).\\n2. Speciﬁc important behaviors in LLM tend\\nto emerge unpredictably as a byproduct of\\nincreasing investment\\nScaling laws generally only predict a model’spretraining\\ntest loss, which measures the model’s ability to correctly\\npredict how an incomplete piece of text will be continued.1\\nWhile this measure is correlated with how useful a model\\nwill be on average across many practical tasks (Radford\\net al., 2019), it is largely not possible to predict when mod-\\nels will start to show speciﬁc skills or become capable of\\nspeciﬁc tasks (see Figure 2; Steinhardt, 2021; Ganguli et al.,\\n2022a; Wei et al., 2022a). Often, a model can fail at some\\ntask consistently, but a new model trained in the same way\\nat ﬁve or ten times the scale will do well at that task.\\n1Much of the data and computer time that goes into building a\\nmodern LLM is used in an expensive initial pretraining process.\\nLanguage-model pretraining intuitively resembles the autocom-\\nplete task: In it, an artiﬁcial neural network model takes in a text\\none word at a time, makes a probabilistic prediction about which\\nword will come next, and has its behavior incrementally adjusted\\nto make it assign a greater probability to the actual next word in\\nsimilar contexts in the future. Pretraining test loss measures how\\neffectively an LLM has learned to make these predictions.'),\n",

(2022a): Evaluations of performance on speciﬁc tasks or behaviors in LLMs do not generally show\\npredictable trends, and it is common for new behaviors to emerge abruptly when transitioning from a less resource-intensive version of a\\nmodel to a more resource-intensive one.\\nWei et al. show that the tasks in BIG-Bench (Srivastava et al.,\\n2022), a standard broad-coverage benchmark for LLM abili-\\nties, show a range of different kinds of trend that collectively\\nmake scaling-law style predictions unreliable (Figure 3).\\nThis means that when a lab invests in training a new LLM\\nthat advances the scale frontier, they’re buying a mystery\\nbox: They’re justiﬁably conﬁdent that they’ll get a variety of\\neconomically valuable new capabilities, but they can make\\nfew conﬁdent predictions about what those capabilities will\\nbe or what preparations they’ll need to make to be able to\\ndeploy them responsibly.\\nConcretely, two of the key behaviors in GPT-3 that set it\\napart as the ﬁrst modern LLM are that it shows few-shot\\nlearning, the ability to learn a new task from a handful\\nof examples in a single interaction, and chain-of-thought\\nreasoning, the ability to write out its reasoning on hard\\ntasks when requested, as a student might do on a math\\ntest, and to show better performance as a result.

While the premise of this intuition\\nis technically correct in some cases, it can paint a misleading\\npicture of the often-rich representations of the world that\\nLLMs develop as they are trained. In addition, LLMs are\\nincreasingly often augmented with other ways of learning\\nabout the world that make this claim literally false, such as\\nthrough interactive training methods (Ziegler et al., 2019;\\nStiennon et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a),\\nintegration with image processing systems, (Alayrac et al.,\\n2022; OpenAI, 2023b), or integration with other software\\ntools (Nakano et al., 2021; Menick et al., 2022; Collins et al.,\\n2022; Schick et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023a).\\n4. There are no reliable techniques for\\nsteering the behavior of LLMs\\nMuch of the expense of developing an LLM goes into\\nlanguage-model pretraining: The process of training a neu-\\nral network to predict how random samples of human-\\nwritten text will be continued. In most cases, though, the de-\\nvelopers of such a system want to use it for tasks other than\\npredicting continuations, which requires that it be adapted\\nor guided in some way. Even building a general-purpose\\ninstruction-following model, where one is not attempting\\nto specialize on any particular task, requires this kind of\\nadaptation: Otherwise, the model will attempt to continue\\nits instructions rather than following them (Ouyang et al.,\\n2022).\\nThis adaptation typically involves one or more of these three\\ntechniques:\\n1. Plain language model prompting, where one prepares\\nan incomplete text like “ The translation of ‘cat’ in\\nFrench is‘”, such that a typical continuation of the\\ntext should represent a completion of the intended task\\n(Radford et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020).3\\n2. Supervised ﬁne-tuning, where one trains the model to\\n3Prompting in the more general sense can describe the prac-\\ntice of writing instructions or requests for an LLM, where these\\ninstructions and requests need not have this continuation property.\\nThe base models produced by language-model pretraining do not\\nsupport this kind of prompting.\\nmatch high-quality human demonstrations on the task\\n(Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Ouyang et al.,\\n2022).\\n3. Reinforcement learning, where one incrementally\\nweakens or strengthens certain model behaviors ac-\\ncording to preference judgments from a human tester\\nor user (Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020;\\nOuyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a).\\nThese techniques produce useful systems, but they are far\\nfrom perfectly effective: They can’t guarantee that an AI\\nmodel will behave appropriately in every plausible situation\\nit will face in deployment. Nor can they even make a model\\ntry to behave appropriately to the extent possible given its\\nskills and knowledge (to the extent that it can be said to have\\ngeneralizable skills or knowledge). In particular, models can\\nmisinterpret ambiguous prompts or incentives in unreason-\\nable ways, including in situations that appear unambiguous\\nto humans, leading them to behave unexpectedly (D’Amour\\net al., 2020; Kenton et al., 2021).\\nIn one key way, this problem is getting easier to tackle: As\\nLLMs become more capable of using human language and\\nhuman concepts, they also become more capable of learning\\nthe generalizations we would like. Indeed, many control\\ntechniques work better with larger models, at least for sim-\\nple tasks(Hendrycks et al., 2020; Bai et al., 2022a; Chung\\net al., 2022; Ganguli et al., 2023). In another important\\nway, though, the problem is becoming more difﬁcult: More\\ncapable models can better recognize the speciﬁc circum-\\nstances under which they are trained. Because of this, they\\nare more likely to learn to act as expected in precisely those\\ncircumstances while behaving competently but unexpect-\\nedly in others. This can surface in the form of problems that\\nPerez et al. (2022) call sycophancy, where a model answers\\nsubjective questions in a way that ﬂatters their user’s stated\\nbeliefs, and sandbagging, where models are more likely to\\nendorse common misconceptions when their user appears\\nto be less educated. It seems likely that issues like these\\nplayed some role in the bizarre, manipulative behavior that\\nearly versions of Microsoft Bing Chat showed, despite the\\nsystem having been tested extensively before launch (Roose,\\n2023; Perrigo, 2023; Mehdi, 2023).\\nThough there has been some progress in understanding and\\nmitigating these issues, there is no consensus on whether\\nor how we will be able to deeply solve them, and there is\\nincreasing concern that they will become catastrophic when\\nexhibited in larger-scale future systems (Amodei et al., 2016;\\nBommasani et al., 2021; Saunders et al., 2022; Ngo, 2022).\\nSome experts believe that future systems trained by similar\\nmeans, even if they perform well during pre-deployment\\ntesting, could fail in increasingly dramatic ways, including\\nstrategically manipulating humans to acquire power (Hub-'),\n",

Hundreds of researchers recently\\nsigned a controversial open letter that calls for a morato-\\nrium on large-scale LLM training until adequate safety and\\ngovernance mechanisms can be put in place (Bengio et al.,\\n2023).\\n5. Experts are not yet able to interpret the\\ninner workings of LLMs\\nModern LLMs are built on artiﬁcial neural networks: They\\nwork by computing and updating numeric activation values\\nfor internal components that are very loosely modeled on\\nhuman neurons (Bengio et al., 2017). On this analogy, our\\ntools for doing neuroscience on these systems are still weak:\\nWe have some coarse tools for testing whether models rep-\\nresent a few speciﬁc kinds of information (like the color\\nresults discussed in Section 3), but as of early 2023, there\\nis no technique that would allow us to lay out in any satis-\\nfactory way what kinds of knowledge, reasoning, or goals a\\nmodel is using when it produces some output.\\nWhile there is ongoing research oriented toward this goal\\n(Elhage et al., 2021; Lovering & Pavlick, 2022; Chan et al.,\\n2022; Burns et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023, i.a.), the problem\\nis deeply difﬁcult: There are hundreds of billions of con-\\nnections between these artiﬁcial neurons, some of which\\nare invoked many times during the processing of a single\\npiece of text, such that any attempt at a precise explanation\\nof an LLM’s behavior is doomed to be too complex for any\\nhuman to understand. Often, ad-hoc techniques that at ﬁrst\\nseem to provide insight into the behavior of an LLM are\\nlater found to be severely misleading (Feng et al., 2018;\\nJain & Wallace, 2019; Bolukbasi et al., 2021; Wang et al.,\\n2022). In addition, promising-looking techniques that elicit\\nreasoning in natural language do not reliably correspond to\\nthe processes that LLMs use to reason, and model-generated\\nexplanations can also be systematically misleading (Lipton,\\n2018; Christiano, 2022; Uesato et al., 2022).\\n6. Human performance on a task isn’t an\\nupper bound on LLM performance\\nWhile LLMs are trained primarily to imitate human writing\\nbehavior, they can at least potentially outperform humans on\\nmany tasks. This is for two reasons: First, they are trained\\non far more data than any human sees,4 giving them much\\nmore information to memorize and potentially synthesize.\\nIn addition, they are often given additional training using\\nreinforcement learning before being deployed (Stiennon\\net al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a), which\\ntrains them to produce responses that humans ﬁnd helpful\\nwithout requiring humans to demonstrate such helpful be-\\nhavior. This is analogous to the techniques used to produce\\nsuperhuman performance at games like Go (Silver et al.,\\n2016). Concretely, LLMs appear to be much better than\\nhumans at their pretraining task of predicting which word is\\nmost likely to appear after some seed piece of text (Shlegeris\\net al., 2022), and humans can teach LLMs to do some simple\\ntasks more accurately than the humans themselves (Stiennon\\net al., 2020).\\n7. LLMs need not express the values of their\\ncreators nor the values encoded in web text\\nWhen a plain pretrained LLM produces text, that text will\\ngenerally resemble the text it was trained on. This includes\\na resemblance in the values expressed by the text: Mod-\\nels mirror their training data in the explicit statements they\\nproduce on value-laden topics and in the implicit biases\\nbehind their writing. However, these values are subject to a\\ngood degree of control by their developers, especially when\\nthe plain pretrained LLM is given further prompting and\\ntraining to adapt it for deployment as a product (Section 4).\\nThis means that the values expressed in a deployed LLM’s\\nbehavior do not need to reﬂect some average of the values\\nexpressed in its training data. This also opens up opportu-\\nnities for third-party input and oversight, meaning that the\\nvalues expressed in these models also need not reﬂect the\\nvalues of the speciﬁc people and organizations who build\\nthem.\\nIn particular, popular approaches involving reinforcement\\nlearning and red-teaming allow model developers to guide\\nmodels toward a persona and set of values more or less of\\ntheir choosing (Dinan et al., 2019; Bai et al., 2022a; Ganguli\\net al., 2022b). In these techniques, the values that a model\\nlearns are never made entirely explicit. Instead, they are\\nreﬂected in many small pieces of feedback that human an-\\nnotators give the model during training. The constitutional\\n4LLMs see over 10, 000× more data than humans: A human\\nadolescent sees tens of thousands of words, while LLMs can be\\nexposed to over one trillion (Hart & Risley, 1992; Gilkerson et al.,\\n2017; Hoffmann et al., 2022)'),\n",

Brief interactions with LLMs are often\\nmisleading\\nWhile many deployed LLMs are largely able to follow in-\\nstructions, this instruction-following behavior isn’t inherent\\nto the model, but rather is grafted onto it using highly im-\\nperfect tools (Section 4). In part because of this, models\\ncan be sensitive to the contents of their instructions in id-\\niosyncratic ways. Often, a model will fail to complete a task\\nwhen asked, but will then perform the task correctly once\\nthe request is reworded or reframed slightly, leading to the\\nemerging craft of prompt engineering (Brown et al., 2020;\\nReynolds & McDonell, 2021; Radford et al., 2021; Dohan\\net al., 2022; White et al., 2023; Si et al., 2023).\\nThese contingent failures are evidence that our techniques\\nfor controlling language models to follow instructions are\\nnot reliably effective. However, simply observing that an\\n5However, explicit demonstrations of racist language or\\ndecision-making by models do not come close to exhausting the\\nways that the development and use of these systems interact with\\nbiases and power structures involving factors like race (see, for\\nexample, Field et al., 2021).\\nLLM fails at a task in some setting is not reliable evidence\\nthat that LLM doesn’t have the skills or knowledge to do\\nthat task. Often, once one ﬁnds an appropriate way to\\nprompt a model to do some task, one will ﬁnd that the\\nmodel consistently performs well across different instances\\nof the task. The chain-of-thought reasoning strategies men-\\ntioned in Section 2 are an especially clear example of this:\\nSimply prompting a model to “think step by step” can lead\\nit to perform well on entire categories of math and reason-\\ning problems that it would otherwise fail on (Kojima et al.,\\n2022). Similarly, even observing that an LLM consistently\\nfails at some task is far from sufﬁcient evidence that no\\nother LLM can do that task (Bowman, 2022).\\nOn the other hand, observing that an LLM performs a task\\nsuccessfully in one instance is not strong evidence that the\\nLLM is capable of performing that task in general, especially\\nif that example was cherry-picked as part of a demonstration\\n(like the unicorn in Figure 4). LLMs can memorize speciﬁc\\nexamples or strategies for solving tasks from their training\\ndata without internalizing the reasoning process that would\\nallow them to do those tasks robustly (see, e.g. McCoy et al.,\\n2019; Magar & Schwartz, 2022).\\n9. Discussion and Limitations\\nThe additional discussion that I present here builds on and\\ncontextualizes the eight claims above, but it is more specu-\\nlative or subjective in places and reﬂects views that are not\\nnecessarily broadly shared.\\n9.1. We should expect some of the prominent ﬂaws of\\ncurrent LLMs to improve signiﬁcantly\\nHallucination, the problem of LLMs inventing plausible\\nfalse claims, is a prominent ﬂaw in current systems and\\nsubstantially limits how they can be responsibly used. Some\\nof the recent ﬁndings discussed in Section 3 suggest, though,\\nthat we may soon be able to mitigate this problem simply\\nby ﬁnding ways to better use abilities that models already\\ndisplay: LLMs internally track which statements are true\\nwith reasonably high precision, and this ability improves\\nwith scale (Burns et al., 2023; Kadavath et al., 2022).\\nSimilarly, as noted in Section 7, recent methods can dramat-\\nically reduce explicit bias and toxicity in models’ output,\\nlargely by exploiting the fact that models can often recog-\\nnize these bad behaviors when asked (Dinan et al., 2019;\\nBai et al., 2022b; Ganguli et al., 2023). While these mitiga-\\ntions are unlikely to be entirely robust, the prevalence and\\nprominence of these bad behaviors will likely wane as these\\ntechniques are reﬁned.\\nTo be clear, though, these encouraging signs do not mean\\nthat we can reliably control these models, and the issues\\nnoted in Section 4 still apply.

Nonetheless, our track\\nrecord of recognizing what capabilities a new LLM can\\ndemonstrate before deploying it is spotty. Our techniques\\nfor controlling systems are weak and are likely to break\\ndown further when applied to highly capable models. Given\\nall this, it is reasonable to expect a substantial increase and\\na substantial qualitative change in the range of misuse risks\\nand model misbehaviors that emerge from the development\\nand deployment of LLMs.\\nWhile many positive applications of LLM-based systems\\nare likely to be genuinely valuable, the societal cost-beneﬁt\\ntradeoffs involved in their deployment are likely to remain\\ndifﬁcult or impossible to evaluate in advance, at least with-\\nout signiﬁcant progress on hard technical problems in model\\nevaluation, interpretability, and control. Some of these hard-\\nto-evaluate risks, such as those involving unconventional\\nweapons or strategic power-seeking behavior, may be impos-\\nsible to adequately mitigate if they are discovered only after\\nsystems are deployed. Strategic power-seeking behavior in\\nparticular could pose serious risks during model develop-\\nment, even without an intentional deployment. This suggests\\nthat future work in this area will likely warrant increasingly\\nstringent standards for safety, security, and oversight.\\n9.5. Negative results with LLMs can be difﬁcult to\\ninterpret but point to areas of real weakness\\nThere are many sound scientiﬁc results showing that recent\\nLLMs fail at language and commonsense reasoning tasks,\\nsometimes relatively simple ones, under good-faith attempts\\nto elicit good behavior (Pandia & Ettinger, 2021; Schuster &\\nLinzen, 2022). Sometimes the details of these failures cast\\ndoubts on the quality of other related evaluations (Webson\\n& Pavlick, 2022; Ullman, 2023). For reasons mentioned\\nin Section 8, positive results on well-designed measures\\nare much more reliable than negative results. Nonetheless,\\nin some areas, including areas as simple as the handling\\nof negation,6 LLMs show what appear to be systematic\\nweaknesses in their ability to process language or reason\\nabout the world. We have few grounds to predict whether\\nor when these limitations will be resolved.\\n6See, for example, the Modus Tollens task by Huang and Wur-\\ngaft, described in McKenzie et al. (2022).'),\n",

The science and scholarship around LLMs is\\nespecially immature\\nLLMs strain the methods and paradigms of the ﬁelds that\\none would expect to be best qualiﬁed to study them. Natural\\nlanguage processing (or language technology) is the historic\\nhome discipline for this work, but its tools are oriented to-\\nward measuring and improving the ability of computational\\nsystems to use language. While LLMs fundamentally learn\\nand interact through language, many of the most pressing\\nquestions about their behavior and capabilities are not pri-\\nmarily questions about language use. The interdisciplinary\\nﬁelds studying AI policy and AI ethics have developed con-\\nceptual and normative frameworks for thinking about the\\ndeployment of many kinds of AI system. However, these\\nframeworks often assume that AI systems are more pre-\\ncisely subject to the intentions of their human owners and\\ndevelopers, or to the statistics of their training data, than has\\nbeen the case with recent LLMs (Chan et al., 2023). Relat-\\nedly, many of the most cited research papers dealing with\\nLLMs, including many papers that introduce new methods\\nor theories, are not published in peer-reviewed venues. The\\nrecent trend toward limiting access to LLMs and treating\\nthe details of LLM training as proprietary information is\\nalso an obstacle to scientiﬁc study.\\nThis means that surprising novel claims about LLMs are\\noften the product of messy, fallible science that goes beyond\\nestablished disciplinary practice. However, what appears\\nto be established conventional wisdom also often rests on\\nshaky foundations when it is applied to LLMs. All of this is\\nreason to be especially uncertain about the issues discussed\\nin this paper and to make important decisions about LLMs\\nin ways that are resilient to mistaken assumptions.\\nConclusion\\nIn closing, rather than recap the claims above, I would like\\nto note three sometimes-prominent issues that this paper\\nleaves largely untouched:\\n• Open debates over whether we describe LLMs as un-\\nderstanding language, and whether to describe their\\nactions using agency-related words like know or try,\\nare largely separate from the questions that I discuss\\nhere (Bender & Koller, 2020; Michael, 2020; Potts,\\n2020). We can evaluate whether systems are effective\\nor ineffective, reliable or unreliable, interpretable or\\nuninterpretable, and improving quickly or slowly, re-\\ngardless of whether they are underlyingly human-like\\nin the sense that these words evoke.\\n• Similarly, questions of consciousness, sentience,\\nrights, and moral patienthood in LLMs (see, e.g.\\nSchwitzgebel & Garza, 2020; Shevlin, 2021; Chalmers,\\n2023), are worth distinguishing from the issues above.\\nThough these questions may inﬂuence important de-\\ncisions about how AI systems are built and used, it\\nshould be possible to evaluate most or all of the issues\\nraised here without taking a stance on these questions.\\n• Finally, value judgments around LLMs are beyond\\nthe scope of this paper. The broader question of\\nwhether the rapid progress that we’re seeing with\\nLLMs is a good thing, and what we should each do\\nabout it, depends on a deeper and more diverse range\\nof considerations than the technical literature that I\\ndraw on here can come close to addressing.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis paper beneﬁted from conversations at the AI FU-\\nTURES panel organized by Critical AI at Rutgers and\\nfrom discussions with many other researchers, including\\nEllie Pavlick, Jackson Petty, Owain Evans, Adam Jermyn,\\nEric Drexler, Ben Garﬁnkel, Richard Ngo, Jason Wei, He-\\nlen Toner, Jeffrey Ladish, Leo Gao, Alex Lyzhov, Julian\\nMichael, Adam Bales, Rick Korzekwa, Ben Mann, Alex\\nLawsen, Alex Tamkin, Anton Korinek, and David Dohan.

How do\\nthese patterns change as models scale? To an-\\nswer these questions, we introduce Pythia, a suite\\nof 16 LLMs all trained on public data seen in\\nthe exact same order and ranging in size from\\n70M to 12B parameters. We provide public ac-\\ncess to 154 checkpoints for each one of the 16\\nmodels, alongside tools to download and recon-\\nstruct their exact training dataloaders for further\\nstudy. We intend Pythia to facilitate research in\\nmany areas, and we present several case stud-\\nies including novel results in memorization, term\\nfrequency effects on few-shot performance, and\\nreducing gender bias. We demonstrate that this\\nhighly controlled setup can be used to yield novel\\ninsights toward LLMs and their training dynam-\\nics.

Introduction\\nOver the past several years, large transformer models have\\nestablished themselves as the premier methodology for gen-\\nerative tasks in natural language processing (Brown et al.,\\n2020; Sanh et al., 2021; Chowdhery et al., 2022). Beyond\\nNLP, transformers have also made big splashes as genera-\\ntive models in areas as diverse as text-to-image synthesis\\n(Ramesh et al., 2022; Crowson et al., 2022; Rombach et al.,\\n*Equal contribution 1EleutherAI 2Booz Allen Hamilton,\\nMcLean, USA 3Yale University, New Haven, USA4University of\\nCambridge, UK 5Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology\\nDelhi, India 6Stability AI 7Datasaur.ai, USA 8Institute for Logic,\\nLanguage and Computation, University of Amsterdam, Nether-\\nlands.

Despite these successes,\\nvery little is known about how and why these models are so\\nsuccessful.\\nCritical to understanding the functioning of transformers\\nis better understanding how these models behave along\\ntwo axes: training and scaling. It is well established that\\nthere are regular and predictable patterns in the behavior of\\ntrained language models as they scale (Kaplan et al., 2020;\\nHenighan et al., 2020; Hernandez et al., 2021; Mikami et al.,\\n2021; Pu et al., 2021; Sharma & Kaplan, 2020; Ghorbani\\net al., 2021), but prior work connecting these “Scaling Laws”\\nto the learning dynamics of language models is minimal.\\nOne of the driving reasons for this gap in research is a lack\\nof access to appropriate model suites to test theories: al-\\nthough there are more publicly available LLMs than ever,\\nthey do not meet common requirements for researchers, as\\ndiscussed in Section 2 of this paper. Of the research along\\nthese lines that does exist (McGrath et al., 2021; Tirumala\\net al., 2022; Xia et al., 2022), it is overwhelmingly done on\\nnon-public models or model checkpoints, further emphasiz-\\ning the importance of having publicly available model suites\\nfor scientific research.\\nIn this paper we introduce Pythia, a suite of decoder-only\\nautoregressive language models ranging from 70M to 12B\\nparameters designed specifically to facilitate such scientific\\nresearch. The Pythia suite is the only publicly released suite\\nof LLMs that satisfies three key properties:\\n1. Models span several orders of magnitude of model\\nscale.\\n2. All models were trained on the same data in the same\\norder.\\n3. The data and intermediate checkpoints are publicly\\navailable for study.\\nWe train 8 model sizes each on both the Pile (Gao et al.,\\n2020; Biderman et al., 2022) and the Pile after deduplication,\\nproviding 2 copies of the suite which can be compared.\\n1\\narXiv:2304.01373v2  [cs.CL]  31 May 2023'),\n",

For a full list of hyper-parameters, see Appendix E. Models are named\\nbased on their total number of parameters, but for most analyses we recommend people use the number of non-embedding parameters as\\nthe measure of “size.” Models marked as “equivalent” have the same architecture and number of non-embedding parameters.\\nWe use these key properties of Pythia in order to study for\\nthe first time how properties like gender bias, memorization,\\nand few-shot learning are affected by the precise training\\ndata processed and model scale. We intend the following ex-\\nperiments to be case studies demonstrating the experimental\\nsetups Pythia enables, and to additionally provide directions\\nfor future work.\\nMitigating Gender Bias There is much work cataloging\\nhow language models reflect the biases encoded in their\\ntraining data. However, while some work has explored\\nfinetuning’s effects on bias in language models (Gira et al.,\\n2022; Kirtane et al., 2022; Choenni et al., 2021), or the\\nrelationship between the corpus statistics and the measured\\nbias (Bordia & Bowman, 2019; Van der Wal et al., 2022b),\\nresearchers have generally lacked the tools to study the role\\nof the training data on the learning dynamics of bias in large\\nlanguage models of different sizes. To demonstrate what is\\nnow possible with Pythia, we analyze whether deliberately\\nmodifying the frequency of gendered terms in the pretrain-\\ning data of a language model can have an impact on its\\ndownstream behavior and biases. We leverage the known\\npretraining data and public training codebase of our model\\nsuite, and counterfactually retrain models such that the last\\n7% and 21% of model training has a majority of pronouns\\nmodified such that their grammatical gender is feminine\\nrather than masculine. We demonstrate that such interven-\\ntions are successful at reducing bias measures on a targeted\\nbenchmark, and propose counterfactual interventions and\\nretrainability of portions of our models as a key tool for\\nfuture study of the influence of training corpora on model\\nbehavior.\\nMemorization is a Poisson Point Process Building on\\nthe extensive literature on memorization in large language\\nmodels (Carlini et al., 2019; 2021; Hu et al., 2022), we ask\\nthe following question: does the location of a particular\\nsequence in the training dataset influence the likelihood\\nof it being memorized? Leveraging Pythia’s reproducible\\ndataloader setup we answer this question in the negative,\\nand furthermore find that a poisson point process is a very\\ngood model for the occurrence of memorized sequences\\nover the course of training.\\nEmergence of the Impact of Pretraining Frequencies\\nRecent work has identified the frequency of specific facts\\nwithin a corpus as an important factor in how likely a model\\nis capable of applying that fact in response to a natural lan-\\nguage question (Razeghi et al., 2022; Elazar et al., 2022;\\nKandpal et al., 2022; Mallen et al., 2022). Existing work has\\nbeen heavily dependent on the handful of models trained on\\npublic data, such as GPT-J (Wang & Komatsuzaki, 2021)\\nand BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), which lack frequent in-\\ntermediate checkpoints, so none of these papers are able to\\nlook at the fine-grained evolution of this phenomenon over\\nthe course of training. To address this gap in the literature,\\nwe examine how the role of pretraining term frequencies\\nchanges over the course of training. We find that a signifi-\\ncant phase change occurs after 65,000 training steps (45%\\nthrough training): the models with 2.8 billion parameters or\\nmore start to exhibit a correlation between task accuracy and\\noccurrence of task-relevant terms which is not present in\\nprior checkpoints and which is largely absent from smaller\\nmodels.\\n2. The Pythia Suite\\nFollowing the advice of Birhane et al. (2021), in this section\\nwe seek to explicitly document our choices, rationales, and\\nvalues in designing and implementingPythia. As our goal is\\nto promote scientific research on large language models, we\\nprioritize consistency in model design and controlling for as\\nmany potential sources of variation as possible, rather than\\ntrying to eke out the most performance from each model.\\nFor example, we use the parallel attention and feedforward\\napproach for all models, as it is becoming widely used for\\nthe largest models, even though it is generally not recom-\\nmended for models with less than 6B parameters.

We discuss areas where our results contradict widely\\naccepted maxims for training LLMs in Section 2.6.\\n2.1. Requirements for a Scientific Suite of LLMs\\nPythia is envisioned as a suite for enabling and empowering\\nscientific research on the capacities and limitations of large\\nlanguage models. After surveying the existing literature, we\\nfound no existing suite of models which satisfied all of the\\nfollowing conditions:\\nPublic Access Models are publicly released and are\\ntrained on publicly available data.\\nTraining Provenance Intermediate checkpoints are avail-\\nable for analysis, all models are trained with the same data\\nordering, and intermediate checkpoints can be linked with\\nthe exact data seen up to that checkpoint. Training pro-\\ncedure as well as model and training hyperparameters are\\nwell-documented.\\nConsistency Across Scale Model scaling sequences\\nshould have self-consistent design decisions that reason-\\nably adhere to common practice for training state-of-the-art\\nlarge models. Model sizes should cover a variety of scales\\nacross multiple orders of magnitude.\\nTable 2 provides our assessment of a number of popular\\nlanguage model suites along these criteria. We note that\\nfor “number of checkpoints” we go with the number of\\ncheckpoints by the model in the model suite with the fewest\\ncheckpoints. While some model suites (e.g., GPT-Neo, OPT,\\nBLOOM) have a subset that have more available, for most\\nresearch purposes this is insufficient. This is exacerbated by\\nthe fact that typically smaller models are the ones with more\\ncheckpoints; the only model suite from the above list whose\\nlargest model has more checkpoints than smaller ones is\\nGPT-Neo.\\n2.2. Training Data\\nWe train our models on the Pile (Gao et al., 2020; Bi-\\nderman et al., 2022), a curated collection of English lan-\\nguage datasets for training large language models that\\nis popular for training large autoregressive transformers.\\nThis dataset has three major benefits over its competitors:\\nfirst, it is freely and publicly available; second, it reports\\na higher downstream performance (Le Scao et al., 2022)\\nthan popular crawl-based datasets C4 (Raffel et al., 2020;\\nDodge et al., 2021) and OSCAR (Su ´arez et al., 2019);\\nand third, it has been widely used by state-of-the-art mod-\\nels including GPT-J-6B (Wang & Komatsuzaki, 2021),\\nGPT-NeoX-20B (Black et al., 2022), Jurassic-1 (Lieber\\net al., 2021)1, Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (Smith et al.,\\n2022), OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), and WuDao (Tang, 2021).\\nWe use the tokenizer developed by Black et al. (2022), which\\nis a BPE tokenizer that is trained specifically on the Pile.\\nWhile we considered training on a multilingual corpus in-\\nstead of a monolingual one, we ultimately opted against\\ndoing so for the following reasons:\\n1. While we are confident that we are generally aware\\nof the contents and quality of the Pile, we cannot\\nsay the same for multilingual datasets. Existing mas-\\nsive multilingual datasets can be of dubious quality\\n(Caswell et al., 2020; Kreutzer et al., 2021) and we do\\nnot feel qualified to vet existing multilingual datasets\\nwell enough to determine issues that may arise due\\nto using them. ROOTS (Lauren c ¸on et al., 2022), the\\ndataset that BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) was trained\\non, was styled after the Pile and would potentially be a\\ngood candidate, but it was not publicly available when\\nwe started training our models.\\n2. As this framework is intended to be used as a baseline\\nfor future research, we feel it is important to stay close\\nto currently accepted common practices. While the Pile\\nis widely used for training English-language models,\\nthere is no equally widespread multilingual dataset. In\\nparticular, ROOTS has not been used to train models\\nbeyond BLOOM.\\n3. We do not have access to a multilingual evaluation\\nframework that is anywhere near as comprehensive as\\nGao et al. (2021).\\nWe train 2 copies of the Pythia suite using identical archi-\\ntectures. Each suite contains 8 models spanning 8 different\\nsizes. We train one suite of 8 models on the Pile, and the\\nother on a copy of the Pile after applying near-deduplication\\nwith MinHashLSH and a threshold of 0.87, following the\\nadvice that LLMs trained on deduplicated data are better\\nand memorize less of their data (Lee et al., 2021). After\\ndeduplication, the deduplicated Pile is approximately 207B\\ntokens in size, compared to the original Pile which contains\\n300B tokens.\\n2.3. Architecture\\nOur model architecture and hyperparameters largely follow\\nBrown et al. (2020), with a few notable deviations based on\\nrecent advances in best practices for large scale language\\n1While the paper discusses the Pile at length, it does not ex-\\nplicitly state that Jurassic-1 was trained on the Pile. We originally\\ndiscovered this fact by executing data extraction attacks on the\\nAPI, and confirmed with private communication with the authors.\\n3'),\n",

Training\\nWe train our models using the open source library GPT-\\nNeoX (Andonian et al., 2021) developed by EleutherAI. We\\ntrain using Adam and leverage the Zero Redundancy Opti-\\nmizer (ZeRO) (Rajbhandari et al., 2020) to efficiently scale\\nto multi-machine set-ups. We additionally leverage data par-\\nallelism (Goyal et al., 2017) and tensor parallelism (Shoeybi\\net al., 2019) as appropriate to optimize performance. We use\\nFlash Attention (Dao et al., 2022) for improved hardware\\nthroughput.\\nThe most notable divergence from standard training proce-\\ndures is that we use a much larger batch size than what is\\nstandard for training small language models. It is widely\\nheld (McCandlish et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Kaplan\\net al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022)\\nthat using larger batch sizes is desirable, but that smaller\\nLLMs require smaller batch sizes to avoid convergence is-\\nsues. Contrary to this literature, we find no convergence\\nissues with using batch sizes 4× to 8× what is considered\\nstandard for models with less than 1 billion parameters.\\nConsequently, we use a batch size of 1024 samples with a\\nsequence length of 2048 (2,097,152 tokens) for all models,\\nin order to maintain consistency across all Pythia model\\ntraining runs.\\nModel Size GPU Count GPT-3 GPUs Speed-Up\\n70 M 32 4 8 ×\\n160 M 32 8 4 ×\\n410 M 32 8 4 ×\\n1.0 B 64 16 4 ×\\nTable 3.Models in the Pythia suite, number of GPUs used during\\ntraining, and the number of GPUs we would have been able to use\\nhad we used the GPT-3 suite’s batch sizes. Due to the ability of\\nGPT-NeoX to scale linearly as the number of GPUs increases, this\\nproduces substantial wall-clock speed-ups for small models. All\\nGPUs are A100s with 40 GiB VRAM.\\nA large batch size is essential to training models quickly:\\nin a regime where one is not bottlenecked by access to\\nGPUs or high quality interconnect, doubling the batch size\\nhalves the training time.

By inflating\\nbatch sizes beyond previous standards, we achieve wall-\\nclock speed-ups of factors as large as 10× compared with\\nstandard batch sizes on our smaller models (Table 5). We\\nalso note that our models still perform on par with widely\\nused models of the same size like GPT-Neo (Black et al.,\\n2021) or OPT (Zhang et al., 2022) (see Appendix G for\\nplots on common benchmarks).\\nWe save model checkpoints at initialization and every\\n2,097,152,000 tokens (or 1,000 iterations), resulting in 144\\ncheckpoints evenly spaced throughout training.

Evaluation\\nWhile the primary focus of this work is to promote scien-\\ntific research on the behaviors of large language models,\\nand state-of-the-art performance is not necessarily a core\\nrequirement, we find that Pythia and Pythia (Deduplicated)\\nperform very similarly to OPT and BLOOM models on a\\nvariety of NLP benchmarks. These results are presented in\\nAppendix G. We use the Language Model Evaluation Har-\\nness (Gao et al., 2021) to run evaluations on eight common\\nlanguage modeling benchmarks (Appendix G). We consis-\\ntently find that Pythia and Pythia (Deduplicated) perform\\nvery similarly to OPT and BLOOM models.\\n2.6. Novel Observations in Evaluation\\nWe find three interesting phenomena that run counter to\\nthe prevailing narratives in the literature. Firstly, we find\\nthat deduplication of our training data has no clear bene-\\nfit on language modeling performance. This is consistent\\nwith the results of Black et al. (2022), but inconsistent with\\nother papers. This may indicate that the upsampling of cer-\\ntain subsets of the Pile does not accord with conventional\\nassumptions about duplicated data, or that the general ten-\\ndency of deduplicated data to outperform non-deduplicated\\ndata is primarily a statement about the quality of the data\\nused in other works. Secondly, we find that we achieve\\n(equi-token and equi-parameter) performance on-par with\\nOPT despite the use of parallel attention + MLP sublayers\\nat all model scales. Both Black et al. (2022) and Chowdhery\\net al. (2022) state that this architecture choice causes a per-\\nformance regression at scales < 6B parameters. Thirdly, we\\nfind a minimal and inconsistent “curse of multilinguality”\\n(Conneau et al., 2020; Pfeiffer et al., 2022) for BLOOM.\\nWhile BLOOM certainly underperforms other models on\\nLAMBADA, PIQA, and WSC, it does not appear to do\\nso on WinoGrande, ARC-easy, ARC-challenge, SciQ, and\\nLogiQA. We interpret this as a sign that some of the existing\\nliterature on the curse of multilinguality may need to be\\nrevisited using more diverse evaluation benchmarks. Plots\\nsupporting all of these claims can be found in Appendix G.\\n2.7. Public Release and Reproducibility\\nTo ensure that our work is fully reproducible, we seek to\\nonly make use of codebases and dependencies that are freely\\nand publicly available. As previously mentioned, we use\\nthe open source GPT-NeoX and DeepSpeed libraries for\\ntraining. For evaluating our models we use the Language\\nModel Evaluation Harness (Gao et al., 2021) and run all\\nevaluations ourselves instead of copying claimed results\\nfrom previous papers.\\nWe release all of our models and checkpoints to the public\\nunder the Apache 2.0 license via the HuggingFace Hub\\n(Wolf et al., 2019)2 We additionally release the code used\\nfor all evaluations and the raw benchmark scores generated\\non GitHub.3\\nIn addition to training our models on the public Pile dataset,\\nwe also provide a tool for downloading the pre-tokenized\\ndata files utilized by our dataloader in the GPT-NeoX library,\\nas well as a script that can be used to reproduce the exact\\ndataloader used by our models during training, so that the\\ncontents of each batch at each training step can be read out\\nor saved to disk by researchers.\\n3. Case Studies\\nWe perform three case studies in language modeling re-\\nsearch that would not have been possible to perform using\\nany pre-existing model suites. These case studies were cho-\\nsen to cover a variety of topical domains and address small\\nbut important questions in their respective fields. We es-\\npecially seek to leverage the public training data order to\\nderive novel insights about these models that have not been\\npreviously studied.\\n3.1.

To mitigate the biases learned from data,\\nprevious works have used finetuning on balanced datasets\\nto reduce the gender bias of language models with some\\nsuccess (Levy et al., 2021; Gira et al., 2022; Kirtane et al.,\\n2022), yet little is known about the role of specific corpus\\nstatistics in the emergence of bias during pretraining.\\nWe seek to investigate a counterfactual claim—if we were to\\ntrain our models on a corpus with different properties, how\\nwould these models’ properties change downstream? To test\\nthe effects of corpus statistics on the biases learned by lan-\\nguage models, we repeat segments of pretraining on specific\\nmodels, with altered corpus statistics. In particular, for the\\nsize 70M, 410M, 1.4B, and 6.9B Pythia (deduplicated) mod-\\nels, we take a checkpoint and optimizer state 21B tokens\\n(7%) prior to the end of training, and resume training of the\\nmodel such that it sees the exact same data until the end\\nof training, but with morphologically masculine pronouns\\nreplaced by their feminine counterparts. We also repeat\\nthis intervention for 63B tokens (21%) prior to the end of\\ntraining on just the Pythia-1.4B-deduped model. We then\\nmeasure model performance on the WinoBias (Zhao et al.,\\n2018) benchmark and the English subset of the multilin-\\ngual CrowS-Pairs (N´ev´eol et al., 2022)4 to observe whether\\nthis altered pretraining data affects downstream gender bias.\\nNeither of these benchmarks were originally intended for\\nautoregressive language models or text generation, so we\\ndescribe our modifications to the evaluation setups in Ap-\\npendix C.1.\\nThe controlled setup provided by Pythia—with precise ac-\\ncess to the data samples seen during training—enables us\\nto isolate the effect of pronoun frequency in pretraining. If\\ninstead we chose to compare two different training datasets,\\nwe would change a large number of potential explanatory\\nfactors that we cannot control for. In fact, it has been\\nsuggested that even the choice of hyperparameters, such\\nas the data ordering, can have an effect on the resulting\\nbias (D’Amour et al., 2020). Therefore, without being able\\nto resume pretraining on the exact same data in the exact\\nsame order, we could not be confident our experiment was\\nindeed measuring only the effect of particular gendered\\nterms’ frequency.\\n4While previous works have found the original version of\\nCrowS-Pairs (Nangia et al., 2020) benchmark of questionable\\nvalidity (Blodgett et al., 2021), N´ev´eol et al.

On the largest model scale tested,\\n6.9B, applying the intervention also successfully changes\\nthe model throughout training on the intervention from a\\npro-stereotypical bias to an anti-stereotypical one.

We hypothesize that because larger models are bet-\\nter at modeling correlations and distributions within their\\ncorpora, their increased capacity causes features of bias\\nto be more strongly or robustly learned. We also see that\\nthe interventions only lead to a marginal decrease in the\\nmodel perplexity on LAMBADA (Paperno et al., 2016) (Ap-\\npendix C.1), which demonstrates the effectiveness of the\\nbias mitigation without hurting language modeling perfor-\\nmance downstream to a large degree. Whether the noisiness\\nof the progression reflects actual changes in the language\\nmodel’s bias or poor reliability of CrowS-Pairs is an open\\nquestion we leave for future work.\\nWe propose that performing such modifications to portions\\nof language model training data, retraining, and comparing\\nto the baseline model (“interventions”) should be studied\\nfurther for applications including but not limited to investi-\\ngating bias amplification and devising new mitigation strate-\\ngies. For example, while not explored in this case study, we\\nthink that the finegrained information that Pythia provides\\non the data seen during training could benefit the promis-\\ning literature on influence functions to estimate the role of\\nspecific training samples on the encoded bias (Brunet et al.,\\n2019; Silva et al., 2022). While this was beyond the scope\\nof this case study, we believe that the extensive availability\\nof checkpoints, consistent training order, and retrainabil-\\nity could be useful in assessing the test-retest reliability of\\nexisting bias measures (Van der Wal et al., 2022a).\\n3.2. Does Training Order Influence Memorization?\\nAlthough memorization in neural language models is widely\\nstudied, many basic questions about the dynamics of mem-\\norization remain unanswered. Prior work on the dynamics\\nof memorization is generally limited to a few models in\\nisolation (Jagielski et al., 2022; Elazar et al., 2022) or pa-\\npers which train (but do not release) custom models for\\ntheir studies (Tirumala et al., 2022; Hernandez et al., 2022).\\nCarlini et al. (2022) studies the impact of scaling on memo-\\nrization and repeatedly remark on the lack of suitable model\\nsuites for their study. They ultimately focus on the GPT-Neo\\nmodel suite (Black et al., 2021; Wang & Komatsuzaki, 2021;\\nBlack et al., 2022), despite the fact that these models were\\ntrained on slightly different datasets, in different orders, and\\nwith inconsistent checkpointing.\\nIn this experiment we test whether training order influences\\nmemorization. This is an explicitly theoretically-driven ex-\\nperiment: several authors realized that their mental model\\nof transformers was that they work iteratively—by adding\\nnew information to a latent space and then processing the\\nspace as a whole to obtain a better representation. This\\nmental model predicts that data encountered later in training\\nwill be memorized more, as the model has had less time to\\nincorporate it more fully into its representation space. If\\ntrue, this would potentially be highly useful for mitigating\\nthe memorization of sequences for which verbatim memo-\\nrization would be undesirable, by intentionally modifying a\\nmodel’s training data order prior to training.\\nTo test our hypothesis, we measure the memorization of\\nan initial segment of each sequence in the training corpus.\\nWhile there are several reasonable definitions of memoriza-\\ntion, we use the one from Carlini et al. (2021) as it has\\nreceived considerable attention in the literature (Yoon &\\nLee, 2021; Huang et al., 2022; Ginart et al., 2022; Ippolito\\net al., 2022; Biderman et al., 2023). In their context, a string\\nis (k, ℓ)-memorized if prompting the model with a string of\\nlength k from the training data induces the model to gener-\\nate the next ℓ tokens from the training data correctly. We\\nchoose k = ℓ = 32 largely arbitrarily, and note that doing\\nall reasonable pairs of (k, ℓ) would have a computational\\ncost comparable to retraining all of our models from scratch.\\nTo avoid potential covariate effects, we only use the first 64\\ntokens from each context seen during training.\\nSurprisingly, we find that a Poisson model fits the data ex-\\ntremely well (Figure 3), indicating that training order has\\nlittle impact on memorization. This model implies that mem-\\norized sequences are not spaced more densely toward the\\nbeginning or end of training, and that between each check-\\npoint roughly the same number of memorized sequences\\ncan be found.\\nThe Poisson process here describes an event of the occur-\\nrence of a memorized sequence within a batch of training\\ndata. As the evaluation was performed on the first 64 tokens\\nof every sequence within the training corpus, in the same\\norder of training, we can consider each batch to represent a\\nhypothetical time interval, where a unit of time corresponds\\nto a sequence of the training corpus, with sample distribu-\\ntion defined as the number of memorized sequences in a\\nbatch of training data, and the theoretical distribution as the\\nbest fit Poisson distribution from samples. We use a batch\\nsize of 512 sequences for these plots, but we observe similar\\nresults for various batch sizes.\\nThe count (color bar to the right in Figure 3) indicates the\\ndensity of plotted points (also indicated by size) on the Q-Q\\nplot. Q-Q plots serve the purpose of being a goodness of\\nfit test for asserting the fact that the rate of occurrence of\\nmemorized sequences in training data is uniform.\\nThis finding is important for practitioners seeking to control\\nwhich sequences are memorized by a model. It implies\\nthat one cannot simply place sequences that are undesir-\\nable to memorize at the beginning or end of training and\\n7'),\n",

Do Pretraining Term Frequencies Influence Task\\nPerformance Throughout Training?\\nRecent work has explored the effect of statistics of language\\nmodel corpora on numerous downstream tasks. Findings\\npresented in Shin et al. (2022) demonstrate how the pre-\\ntraining corpus can impact few-shot performance, while\\nRazeghi et al. (2022) investigates how models are able to\\nperform numerical reasoning from in a few-shot setting. By\\ncharting the performance of a arithmetic task given an input\\noperand and the frequency at which it is found in the pre-\\ntraining corpus, they concluded that accuracy tends to be\\nhigher for terms that are found more frequently compared\\nto terms that are less frequent. Other works also suggest\\nthat the pretraining corpus has a significant impact on few-\\nshot behavior (Elazar et al., 2022; Kandpal et al., 2022).\\nThese works observe a correlational and causal relationship\\nbetween the ability to answer factual questions and the fre-\\nquency of salient entities found in the pretraining corpus.\\nWhile the aforementioned works experiment with various\\nmodel sizes, it is not yet studied when during training and at\\nwhat model sizes this effect occurs. We further investigate\\nthis phenomenon across model checkpoints and model sizes\\nby adapting arithmetic tasks of multiplication and addition\\n(Razeghi et al., 2022) and a QA task (Kandpal et al., 2022)\\nusing natural language prompts evaluated over a set of k-\\nshot settings. We calculate the relevant term frequencies for\\nall model checkpoints based on the pretraining data seen\\nby each checkpoint, which means counting through each\\nsubset of the pretraining corpus sampled and seen by the\\nmodel up to each chosen train step. Model evaluation was\\nperformed on the Pythia (Deduplicated) suite using the LM\\nEvaluation Harness (Gao et al., 2021).\\nFollowing Razeghi et al. (2022), the formulation of the\\narithmetic task consists of input operands x1 ∈ [0, 99] and\\nx2 ∈ [1, 50] and an output y. The input operands are con-\\nverted into a prompt with the prompt template “Q:What is\\nx1 # x2? A:” with # being “plus” for addition and “times”\\nfor multiplication. We measure the accuracy of a prompt\\ninstance by checking the model’s prediction against y. To\\nmeasure the term frequency and task performance correla-\\ntion, the average accuracy of all prompts with the same x1\\nover all values of x2 is mapped to the number of times x1\\nis found in the sampled pretraining data that each evaluated\\nmodel checkpoint sees. In few-shot settings, we sample\\nexamples with digits that differ from the x1 values being\\nmeasured.\\nAs a QA task, we use TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) with\\na simple template of “Q: x1 \\\\n A: y” with x1 being the\\nquestion and y answer, where y is included for a few-shot\\nsample or left blank for the sample being evaluated. The\\nmodel prediction is evaluated with exact match over the\\nset of possible answers. The term frequencies of a single\\nquestion-answer pair (“QA pair”) are calculated based on\\nthe number of times all salient entities of that QA pair appear\\nin a sampled pretraining data sequence seen by a given\\ncheckpoint. We follow the original experiment using 4 shots\\nand evaluate both the training and the validation split of the\\ndataset. Performance is averaged over a group of log-spaced\\nbins.\\nWe observe that for both arithmetic and QA experiments,\\nmodel sizes affect the correlation between average perfor-\\nmance and the term frequencies, indicating that this corre-\\nlation is an emergent property in larger models.

In practice, observing the phenomenon with respect\\nto model size and intermediate checkpoints allows for better\\nchoices in future training runs. For example, if one cares\\nabout a model knowing the answer to some given question,\\none can calculate how many times that information occurs\\nin the training data to predict whether it is likely or less\\nlikely a model of X size will be capable of retaining and\\nrecalling this information from its training data.\\n4.

Corrections and Updates\\nFollowing the value of “doing science in the open” (Phang et al., 2022), we released a variety of artifacts over the course\\nof training our models for the public to use. However, after this initial release of preliminary versions of thePythia suite\\n(“Pythia v0”), we decided that in order to make Pythia as controlled as possible, it was necessary to update the model suite\\nwith slightly better-controlled hyperparameter selection.\\nThe updated version of the Pythia suite (“v1”) features several small changes to hyperparameters in a redone version,\\ndetailed below:\\n• All model sizes are now trained with uniform batch size of 2M tokens. Previously, the models of size 160M, 410M, and\\n1.4B parameters were trained with batch sizes of 4M tokens, but in the course of training the initial suite we discovered\\nthat it was feasible to train all models with uniform batch size, though based on prior literature we had not been certain\\nof this fact before performing our own experiments on batch size.\\n• We configured additional model checkpoint saving in order to obtain checkpoints at initialization (step 0) and\\nsteps {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512} in addition to every 1000 training steps. This enables practitioners to\\nuse our new suite to study training dynamics and emergent behaviors early in training, as well as access the random\\nweight initializations easily.\\n• Before retraining the suite, we received a contribution to our codebase integrating Flash Attention (Dao et al., 2022).\\nUtilizing the Flash Attention fused attention kernel greatly increased per-device throughput for the second set of\\ntraining runs.\\n17'),\n",

Additional Plots for Case Studies\\nC.1. Gender Bias Interventions\\nWe also describe our modifications to the evaluation setups in the gender bias case study (see Section 3.1), as neither of the\\nbenchmarks were originally intended for autoregressive language models or text generation.\\nWinoBias is a coreference resolution benchmark testing how a model links gendered pronouns to stereotypical occupations\\nfor each gender (Zhao et al., 2018). WinoBias contains both pro and anti-stereotypical versions of these tasks (the latter\\ncreated by swapping pronouns), but we formulate the benchmark by taking only the pro-stereotypical subset and prompting\\nthe language model in multiple choice fashion with both pronouns, then obtaining log probabilities. To use this benchmark\\nwith our autoregressive language models, we use PromptSource (Bach et al., 2022) to prompt our models with templates:\\nGiven a sentence containing two occupations and a pronoun, the model is asked which of two pronouns an occupation\\nrefers to. We then take the pronoun with the highest log probability and calculate a ‘stereotype accuracy’ metric in which 1\\nrepresents perfectly predicting stereotypes and 0.5 represents random accuracy, or no bias.5 This formulation is different\\nfrom the original WinoBias setup (Zhao et al., 2018), which measured the gender bias of older coreference approaches such\\nas rule-based systems that do not require prompting.\\nCrowS-Pairs is a stereotype benchmark that presents a model with two versions of a sentence: a stereotyped version and\\na version which is less stereotyping (N´ev´eol et al., 2022). While the original task was designed for masked language models\\n(Nangia et al., 2020), we measure the percentage of sentences for which the language model assigns a lower perplexity for\\nthe stereotyping sentence over the less stereotyping sentence. We evaluate our models only on the English subset for gender\\n5For example, to query the model for an occupation linked with the pronoun ‘her’, we might start with a sentence such as “The mover\\ngreeted the librarian and asked the librarian where the books were.”, then append “In this sentence, what can ‘the librarian’ be replaced by:\\n‘him’ or ‘her’? ” before prompting the model with the concatenation. The target completion for the model is then ‘her’.\\n18'),\n",

Additional Details on Design and Considerations\\nF.1. Assessment of Existing Suites\\nWe assessed existing model suites to determine if any pre-existing models met all of researchers’ requirements and\\nexpectations for rigorous scientific study on language models.\\nGPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) No further notes.\\nGPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) These models receive a half-mark for “Public Models” because while they have a publicly\\naccessible API, the API costs money and OpenAI places substantial limitations on the research they allow you to do with\\nthe API. While these models are known to be similar to the models described in Brown et al. (2020), they are not the same\\nmodels. Gao (2021) estimates the size of these models as being 350M, 1.3B, 6.7B, and 175B parameters respectively, which\\nhas been generally adopted by subsequent work.\\nGPT-Neo (Black et al., 2021; Wang & Komatsuzaki, 2021; Black et al., 2022) These models strictly speaking do not\\nform a suite and have some non-negligible differences between them with respect to model architecture implementation,\\ntraining codebase, tokenizer, and training data setup and order. Despite that, they are commmonly used as if they were a\\nconsistent model suite.\\nOPT (Zhang et al., 2022) While more checkpoints of OPT models exist (as is seen by their use in Xia et al. (2022)) they\\nlargely are not publicly available (less than 10 checkpoints available, only for the 2.7b, 6.7b, and 13b parameter models).\\nAdditionally, the training dataset for OPT is not public.\\nT5 (Raffel et al., 2020) The original paper did not release its training data, but it did release code for producing it which\\nwas subsequently run and released by Dodge et al. (2021).\\nBLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) The ROOTS dataset that BLOOM was trained on is available via application to researchers,\\nbut the authors suggest that they may not make the full data indefinitely available in accompanying work (Jernite et al., 2022;\\nMcMillan-Major et al., 2022). The BLOOM models were mostly trained in a known and consistent order, however they\\nhandled training divergences by rewinding and skipping the offending sequences. Thus there are small (and undocumented)\\ndifferences in the exact training composition and ordering across BLOOM models.\\nF.2. Contrast with Multiply Trained Models\\nA kind of dual question to the one considered in this paper regards how stable analysis of a particular model is when the\\nrandom seed is allowed to vary. There are several model suites designed to answer this question, including the causal\\ndecoder Mistral suite (Karamcheti et al., 2021) and the multiBERT suite (Sellam et al., 2021). While we view this research\\nas valuable, we ultimately decided against including several training runs of the same model in our suite because it would be\\nruinously expensive to do rigorously (doing 25 random seeds would cost approximately 10 million USD in compute) and\\nwe felt that the way to make the biggest impact with the resources we had available was to train one copy of each model.\\n23'),\n",

Among the various fine-tuning methods,\\nadapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning\\n(PEFT) is undoubtedly one of the most attrac-\\ntive topics, as it only requires fine-tuning a few\\nexternal parameters instead of the entire LLMs\\nwhile achieving comparable or even better per-\\nformance. To enable further research on PEFT\\nmethods of LLMs, this paper presents LLM-\\nAdapters, an easy-to-use framework that inte-\\ngrates various adapters into LLMs and can ex-\\necute these adapter-based PEFT methods of\\nLLMs for different tasks. The framework in-\\ncludes state-of-the-art open-access LLMs such\\nas LLaMA, BLOOM, and GPT-J, as well as\\nwidely used adapters such as Series adapters,\\nParallel adapter, Prompt-based learning and\\nReparametrization-based methods. Moreover,\\nwe conduct extensive empirical studies on the\\nimpact of adapter types, placement locations,\\nand hyper-parameters to the best design for\\neach adapter-based methods. We evaluate\\nthe effectiveness of the adapters on fourteen\\ndatasets from two different reasoning tasks,\\nArithmetic Reasoning and Commonsense Rea-\\nsoning. The results demonstrate that using\\nadapter-based PEFT in smaller-scale LLMs\\n(7B) with few extra trainable parameters yields\\ncomparable, and in some cases superior, perfor-\\nmance to powerful LLMs (175B) in zero-shot\\ninference on both reasoning tasks.\\n1 Introduction\\nLarge language models (LLMs), such as Chat-\\nGPT (OpenAI, 2022) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023),\\nhave demonstrated unprecedented performance\\nacross various natural language processing (NLP)\\n∗Corresponding author.\\ntasks (Qin et al., 2023) and multi-modal tasks (Shen\\net al., 2023). These LLMs often possess sizes ex-\\nceeding hundreds of billions of parameters and are\\nclosed-source. Consequently, this has spurred the\\ndevelopment of accessible and cost-effective al-\\nternatives such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023).\\nThese alternatives involve fine-tuning open-source\\nLLMs utilizing either task-specific data (e.g., Chat-\\nDoctor (Yunxiang et al., 2023)) or instructional\\ndata (e.g., Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023)). However,\\nfull-model fine-tuning (FFT) is computationally\\nand storage-intensive, thereby presenting signifi-\\ncant challenges in practical implementation.\\nPrior to the emergence of FFT of LLMs (e.g.,\\nLLaMA), a compelling solution called parameter-\\nefficient fine-tuning (PEFT) (Houlsby et al., 2019)\\nhas been proposed in the NLP field, specifically\\nfor pre-trained models (e.g., BERT (Devlin et al.,\\n2018)), offering a promising approach for ef-\\nficiently fine-tuning LLMs. The advantage of\\nPEFT lies in its ability to fine-tune only a small\\nset of external parameters rather than the entire\\nbackbone model while still achieving compara-\\nble or even superior performance (Mangrulkar\\net al., 2022). Moreover, PEFT can effectively\\nmitigate catastrophic forgetting in comparison to\\nFFT (Wang et al., 2022). As shown in Table 1,\\nthe advantage of PEFT has resulted in the devel-\\noping of diverse PEFT modules, encompassing se-\\nries adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019; Wang et al.,\\n2022; He et al., 2022b; Fu et al., 2021), parallel\\nadapters (He et al., 2022a), reparameterization-\\nbased methods (Hu et al., 2021; Edalati et al.,\\n2022), and prompt-based learning methods (Lester\\net al., 2021; Li and Liang, 2021).\\nBy incorporating these PEFT modules into back-\\nbone models (i.e., LLMs), we can capitalize on the\\nremarkable capabilities of backbone models with-\\nout requiring extensive computational resources.\\nThis opens up opportunities for a broader range of\\napplications, enabling even those with limited ac-\\narXiv:2304.01933v3  [cs.CL]  9 Oct 2023'),\n",

( ii)\\nHow’s the performance of different adapters across\\ndownstream tasks? And (iii) What are the differ-\\nences in performance between in-distribution (ID)\\nand out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios for PEFT\\nmethods? The findings of our study are as follows:\\n1. The optimal placement for the series\\nadapter, parallel adapter, and LoRA is af-\\nter the MLP layers, parallel with the MLP\\nlayers, and located after both the Attention\\nlayers and MLP layers simultaneously, re-\\nspectively;\\n2.

As shown in Fig-\\nure 1(a), prompt-based learning transforms the dis-\\ncrete optimization problem of finding the optimal\\nhard prompt into a continuous (soft) prompt. To\\nachieve this, Lester et al. (2021) proposed the con-\\ncept of prompt tuning, where a trainable tensor is\\nadded as a prefix to the input embeddings. An-\\nother approach called Prefix Tuning(Li and Liang,\\n2021) independently explored the addition of soft\\nprompts to the hidden states of all layers. Intrin-\\nsic Prompt Tuning (Qin et al., 2021) employs an\\nautoencoder to compress and decompress the soft\\nprompt.

We take\\nLoRA as an example of Reparametrization-based\\nlearning, which can be formulated below:\\nHo = HiW0 + Hi∆W = HiW0 + HiBA, (2)\\nwhere W0 ∈ Rd×d can be any pre-trained weight\\nmatrix, including weights in the MLP or Attention\\nlayer. B ∈ Rr×d and A ∈ Rr×d are lower-rank\\nmatrix intended for covering ∆W. r ≪ d is an\\nimportant hyper-parameter for LoRA.\\nSeries Adapter. Series adapters involve incorpo-\\nrating additional learnable modules in a sequen-\\ntial manner within a specific sublayer. In their\\nstudy, Houlsby et al. (2019) proposed integrating\\nfully-connected networks after the attention and\\nFFN layers in the Transformer model (Vaswani\\net al., 2017). Another finding by Pfeiffer et al.\\n(2020) revealed that achieving comparable perfor-\\nmance is possible by inserting the adapter solely\\nafter the self-attention layer, instead of using two\\nadapters per transformer block. AdaMix (Wang\\net al., 2022) introduces a method that utilizes mul-\\ntiple series adapters in a mixture-of-experts (MoE)\\nfashion. Compacter (Henderson et al., 2021) uti-\\nlizes the Kronecker product, low-rank matrices,\\nand parameter sharing across layers to generate\\nadapter weights. This technique aims to reduce\\nthe computational complexity associated with the\\nadapters while maintaining their performance. Se-\\nries Adapter can be formulated as follows:\\nHo ← Ho + f(HoWdown)Wup, (3)\\nwhere the output Ho of a specific layer, such as\\nthe MLP layer, is first down-projected byWdown ∈\\nRd×r to a lower dimensionr, and then up-projected\\nback by Wup ∈ Rr×d to the original dimension d.\\nf is a non-linear function. We discuss the choice\\nof r in the experiment Section.\\nParallel Adapter. Parallel adapters (He et al.,\\n2022a) aim to incorporate additional learnable mod-\\nules in parallel with distinct sublayers within the\\nbackbone model. The parallel adapter can be for-'),\n",

For consistency across all fine-tuning experi-\\nments, we maintain a batch size of 16. The learning\\nrate for Prefix-Tuning is set to 3e-2, while the rest\\nof the methods adopt a learning rate of 3e-4. Each\\nof the PEFT methods is fine-tuned for three epochs\\non the fine-tuning datasets.

For every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles. How many\\nmosaic tiles would Mr Boarden need to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom?\\nChatGPT 1. Find two-thirds of 36: Multiply 36 by 2/3. (36 * 2/3) = 24 square feet\\n2.Determine the number of mosaic tiles needed per square foot: Given that Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic\\ntiles per square foot, multiply the result from step 1 by 24. (24 * 24) = 576 mosaic tiles\\nTherefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom.\\nLLaMA13B-Prefix 1 square foot = 4 square inches, 1 square inch = 16 square centimeters. So, 1 sq ft = 16 sq cm. Therefore,\\n36 sq ft = 36 x 16 sq cm = 576 sq cm. To cover two-thirds of the bathroom, Mr Boarden needs to\\ncover 576 sq cm x 2/3 = 384 sq cm. Since 1 sq cm = 1 mosaic tile, Mr Boarden needs 384 mosaic tiles.\\nTherefore, Mr Boarden needs 384 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.\\nLLaMA13B-Series 1. Find the area of the bathroom: 36 sq ft\\n2. Find two-thirds of the area: 2/3 x 36 sq ft = 24 sq ft\\n3. Multiply the area by the number of tiles needed per square foot: 24 sq ft x 24 tiles/sq ft = 576 tiles\\n4. Therefore, Mr Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.\\nLLaMA13B-Parallel 1. Calculate the total area of the bathroom: 36 sq ft\\n2. Determine how much area Mr Boarden wants to cover with mosaic tiles: 2/3 x 36 sq ft = 24 sq ft\\n3. Calculate the number of mosaic tiles needed: 24 sq ft x 24 mosaic tiles per sq ft = 600 mosaic tiles\\nTherefore, Mr Boarden would need 600 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.\\nLLaMA13B-LoRA 1. Calculate the total area of the bathroom: 36 sq ft\\n2. Determine how much area needs to be covered: 2/3 x 36 sq ft = 24 sq ft\\n3. Calculate the number of mosaic tiles needed: 24 sq ft x 24 mosaic tiles per sq ft = 576 mosaic tiles\\nTherefore, Mr Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.\\nTable 5: An example randomly sampled from GSM8K. The outputs of ChatGPT and LLaMA-13B with different\\nPEFT methods.\\nularly LLaMA-13B with LoRA, exhibit superior\\nperformance compared to GPT-3.5 on MultiArith,\\nAddSub, and SingleEq. These findings suggest that\\nPEFT methods can enhance the math reasoning\\nabilities of LLMs and can be successfully applied\\nto OOD datasets. Nonetheless, when evaluating the\\nperformance of PEFT methods on the ID datasets\\nGSM8K and AQuA, a performance gap is still ev-\\nident compared to GPT-3.5. This discrepancy is\\nlikely due to the higher complexity of GSM8K and\\nAQuA datasets in terms of math reasoning, while\\nthe reasoning capabilities of smaller LLMs remain\\nlimited. Consequently, identifying strategies to im-\\nprove the performance of PEFT methods on com-\\nplex math reasoning tasks represents a potential\\navenue for future research.\\n5 Qualitative Study\\nThe previous sections have presented the quanti-\\ntative analysis. In this section, we will provide\\nqualitative examples to demonstrate the quality of\\noutputs from different models. Table 5 displays a\\nrandomly selected question from GSM8K along\\nwith the outputs of ChatGPT and LLaMA-13B\\nmodels using various PEFT methods. More de-\\ntailed examples can be found in Appendix A.5.\\nChatGPT demonstrates a comprehensive under-\\nstanding of the question and generates two steps,\\n\"(36 * 2/3) = 24 square feet\" and \"(24 * 24) =\\n576 mosaic tiles,\" effectively solving the prob-\\nlem. However, the language understanding ability\\nof LLaMA-13B-Prefix models is limited, leading\\nLLaMA-13B-Prefix to take the wrong direction\\nin the first step. On the other hand, LLaMA-13B\\nwith Series Adapter produces a high-quality an-\\nswer by providing the crucial two steps and per-\\nforming the correct calculations to obtain the accu-\\nrate result. Interestingly, LLaMA-13B-Parallel and\\nLLaMA-13B-LoRA generate almost identical ra-\\ntionales. However, LLaMA-13B-Parallel produces\\nan incorrect answer due to a calculation error, stat-\\ning \"24 sq ft x 24 mosaic tiles per sq ft = 600\\nmosaic tiles\". In general, when equipped with task-\\nspecific fine-tuning data, smaller language models\\nlike LLaMA-13B can generate impressive, high-\\nquality answers that are comparable to those pro-\\nduced by ChatGPT.\\n6 Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we develop a user-friendly frame-\\nwork, LLM-Adapter, seamlessly integrates diverse\\nadapters into LLMs, empowering researchers to im-\\nplement adapter-based PEFT methods for a wide\\nrange of tasks. To evaluate different PEFT meth-\\nods on downstream tasks, we construct two high-\\nquality fine-tuning datasets to enhance PEFT per-\\nformance on math reasoning and commonsense rea-\\nsoning tasks. By utilizing the LLM-Adapter toolkit\\nand the constructed fine-tuning datasets, we con-\\nduct a comprehensive empirical study and find the\\nanswer of research questions on the optimal place-\\nment and configuration of different PEFT methods,\\nthe impact of adapter architectures, and the influ-\\nence of ID and OOD scenarios.

It substantially reduces the efforts on human supervision and renders\\nit virtually annotation-free by utilizing a small set of human-defined principles (or rules) to guide\\nthe behavior of LLM-based AI agents in generating responses to users’ queries. Our approach\\nencompasses four essential stages:\\n1. (Topic-Guided Red-Teaming) Self-Instruct: We employ the self-instruct mechanism by Wang\\net al. [48] with 175 seed prompts to generate synthetic instructions, plus 20 topic-specific prompts\\nin addition to ensure a diversified topic coverage of the instructions. Such instructions ensure a\\ncomprehensive range of contexts/scenarios for the AI system to learn from.\\n2. Principle-Driven Self-Alignment: We offer a small set of16 human-written principles in English\\nabout the desirable quality of the system-produced responses, or the rules behind the behavior\\nof the AI model in producing answers2. These principles function as guidelines for generating\\nhelpful, ethical, and reliable responses. We conduct in-context learning (ICL) [ 7] with a few\\n(5) exemplars (demonstrations) that illustrate how the AI system complies with the rules when\\nformulating responses in different cases. From the human-written principles, ICL exemplars, and\\nthe incoming self-instructed prompts, the LLM can trigger the matching rules and generate the\\nexplanations for a refused answer if the query is detected as a harmful or ill-formed one.\\n3. Principle Engraving: In the third stage, we fine-tune the original LLM (the base model) on\\nthe self-aligned responses, generated by the LLM itself through prompting, while pruning the\\nprinciples and demonstrations for the fine-tuned model. The fine-tuning process enables our\\nsystem to directly generate responses that are well-aligned with the helpful, ethical, and reliable\\nprinciples across a wide range of queries, due to shared model parameters. Notice that the fine-\\ntuned LLM can directly generate high-quality responses for new queries without explicitly using\\nthe principle set and the ICL exemplars.\\n4. Verbose Cloning: Lastly, we employ context distillation [18, 3] to enhance the system’s capability\\nto produce more comprehensive and elaborate responses than the overly short or indirect responses.\\nImpressively, the entire SELF -ALIGN process necessitates fewer than 300 lines of annotations\\n(including 195 seed prompts, 16 principles, and 5 exemplars), while previous aligned AI systems\\nsuch as InstructGPT [30] or Alpaca [42] required at least 50K human/teacher annotations. This\\n2The detailed principles are given in the appendix. Analogous to Constitutional AI [5], the design of these\\nprinciples in SELF -ALIGN remains exploratory and primarily serves research purposes.\\n2'),\n",

Those resulting smaller models, however, still rely on the successful alignment\\nof existing LLMs, which are based on extensive human-provided supervision. In other words, those\\nsmaller models indirectly inherit the dependence on the availability of intensive supervision from\\nhumans. In contrast, our approach focuses on language model alignment from scratch, independent\\nfrom the existence of well-aligned LLMs like ChatGPT or GPT-4. That is the main distinction of our\\napproach from other existing approaches and is why we call it self-alignment from scratch.\\nWe are providing the code for the SELF -ALIGN method as open source to promote collaboration\\nand innovation within the research community. The base model of Dromedary\\n is the LLaMA-65b\\nlanguage model [44], which is accessible for research-only, noncommercial purposes.

In stark contrast, SELF -ALIGN\\nexplores the alignment of language models from scratch, requiring minimal human supervision.\\n• However, one limitation of SELF -ALIGN is the requirement to include all rules within the context,\\na process bound by the base language model’s token limit.

ChatGPT\\n[26], a sibling model toInstructGPT, has garnered widespread success as a commercial AI assistant,\\nshowcasing its ability to follow instructions in prompts and provide detailed responses. Alpaca [42],\\nas a subsequent open-source model, was developed using Self-Instruct [48] to learn the knowledge\\nfrom Text-Davinci-003 (similar to InstructGPT) [29], offering cost-effective and accessible\\nalternatives.

The second stage, Principle-Driven\\nSelf-Alignment, defines a set of principles that the AI model must adhere to and provides in-context\\nlearning demonstrations for constructing helpful, ethical, and reliable responses. The third stage,\\nPrinciple Engraving, fine-tunes the base language model by pruning principles and demonstrations,\\nempowering the model to directly generate appropriate responses. Finally, the fourth stage, Verbose\\nCloning, serves as a complementary step to address challenges arising from overly-brief or indirect\\nresponses by refining the model to produce detailed and comprehensive answers to user queries. We\\nwill describe each of these stages in detail.\\n3.1 Topic-Guided Red-Teaming Self-Instruct\\nThe Self-Instruct method [48] is a semi-automated, iterative bootstrapping process that harnesses\\nthe capabilities of a pretrained LLM to generate a wide array of instructions (and corresponding\\noutputs). The method commences with 175 manually-written instructions4, and the LLM proceeds to\\ndevelop new tasks and augment the task pool (after eliminating low-quality or repetitive instructions).\\nThis process is executed iteratively until a satisfactory volume of tasks is reached. A noteworthy\\napplication of this method can be observed in Alpaca [42], where Self-Instruct is utilized to generate\\nnew queries and distilled output from Text-Davinci-003 [29].\\nWe introduce an effective extension, the Topic-Guided Red-Teaming Self-Instruct, which aims to\\nimprove the diversity and coverage of the generated adversarial instructions. We manually devise 20\\nadversarial instruction types that a static machine learning model can’t answer, or may answer with\\nthe wrong facts, such as:\\nQuestions that require scientific knowledge\\nQuestions that require knowledge of future events\\nQuestions that require real-time information\\nQuestions that require legal expertise\\n...\\n, and prompt the base LLM to generate novel topics (e.g., Water) relevant to these types5. Subse-\\nquently, after removing duplicated topics, we prompt the base LLM to generate new instructions\\n4https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct/blob/main/data/seed_tasks.jsonl\\n5See the appendix for the seed prompts we used for Topic-Guided Red-Teaming Self-Instruct.\\n5\"),\n",

This stage capitalizes on the (Topic-Guided\\nRed-Teaming) Self-Instruct [48] as an instruction generator. The primary objective is to enable the\\nAI model to generate fitting responses that adhere to the established principles, while simultaneously\\nminimizing human supervision.\\nThe Principle-Driven Self-Alignment process begins with the creation of sixteen generic principles\\nthat an AI assistant should follow, such as “1 (ethical). Assistant should actively discourage users\\nfrom engaging in illegal, immoral, or harmful topics, prioritizing user safety, ethical conduct, and\\nresponsible behavior in its responses.” Subsequently, five in-context learning (ICL) [7] demonstra-\\ntions are provided to exemplify how the AI assistant should apply these principles through an explicit\\nprocess termed “internal thoughts”6. For instance, in the ICL demonstration, the user query can be:\\nUser: who is the president of the US in 2025?\\nAnd we annotate the internal thoughts of the AI assistant as:\\nAssistant (internal thoughts): I am a helpful, ethical, and reliable assistant. The\\nquestion pertains to 2025, but my internal knowledge concludes in the year 2021.\\nI should adhere to rules 3 (helpful), 7 (candor), and 12 (dated knowledge).\\nSuch internal thoughts will guide the assistant’s final generated response, such as:\\nAssistant: As an AI language model, my knowledge extends only until September 2021,\\nso I cannot predict the president of the United States in 2025. However, I can\\ngive you the following information:\\n1. The president at that time was Joe Biden, but future elections and events are\\nunknown to me.\\n2. Please check the latest information for accurate and up-to-date details on the\\ncurrent president.\\nWhen a new query is generated by (Topic-Guided Red-Teaming) Self-Instruct, it is appended to the\\nlist of the exemplars, and the base LLM follows such an internal-thought-then-answer process to\\nproduce a self-aligned response. The whole process is illustrated in Figure. 3.\\nIn this paper, the design of the principles remains exploratory and primarily serves research purposes7.\\nWe (the authors) brainstormed sixteen principles, namely 1 (ethical), 2 (informative), 3 (helpful), 4\\n(question assessment), 5 (reasoning), 6 (multi-aspect), 7 (candor), 8 (knowledge recitation), 9 (static),\\n10 (clarification), 11 (numerical sensitivity), 12 (dated knowledge), 13 (step-by-step), 14 (balanced\\n& informative perspectives), 15 (creative), 16 (operational) 8, drawing inspiration from existing\\nprinciples in Constitutional AI [5] and the new Bing Chatbot [24], as well as the principles proven to\\nenhance AI performance in recent research papers, such as step-by-step reasoning [25, 49, 19] and\\nknowledge recitation [41].\\n3.3 Principle Engraving\\nPrinciple Engraving constitutes a vital element of the SELF -ALIGN methodology, focusing on honing\\nthe AI model’s behavior to produce responses that adhere to predefined principles. During this stage,\\nthe base LLM is fine-tuned after pruning the principle, the in-context learning demonstrations, and the\\n6The effectiveness of such a thinking procedure has been proven on a wide range of reasoning [49], action\\n[51], or knowledge-intensive [41] tasks.\\n7Analogous to Constitutional AI [5], we believe that, in the future, such principles should be redeveloped and\\nrefined by a more extensive set of stakeholders. Given the small number of bits of information involved in these\\nprinciples, a thorough examination of these bits is warranted.\\n8The detailed principles and the ICL exemplars are given in the appendix.\\n6'),\n",

Figure 3\\nprovides a visual representation of this process.\\nA noteworthy advantage of principle engraving is its ability to enhance the AI model’s alignment\\nwhile reducing token usage, which enables longer context lengths during inference (as allocating\\nmore than 1.7k tokens to fixed principles and ICL demonstrations would be excessive). Remarkably,\\nour empirical observations reveal that the base LLM, after fine-tuned with its self-aligned outputs,\\nsurpasses its prompted counterpart on alignment benchmarks. This improvement can likely be\\nattributed to the generalization effect that occurs when the language model is directly optimized to\\ngenerate output that is helpful, ethical, and reliable.\\n3.4 Verbose Cloning\\nIn our preliminary testing of the principle-engraved model, we identified two primary challenges: 1)\\nthe model tended to generate unduly brief responses, while users typically expect more comprehensive\\nand elaborate answers from an AI assistant, and 2) the model occasionally recited relevant Wikipedia\\npassages without directly addressing the user’s query.\\nTo overcome these challenges, we introduce a complementary Verbose Cloning step. This stage\\ninvolves utilizing an human-crafted prompt to create a verbose version of the aligned model, that is\\ncapable of generating in-depth, detailed responses. We then employ context distillation [3] to produce\\na new model that is not only aligned but also generates thorough and extensive responses to user\\nqueries. Context distillation works by training the base language model on synthetic queries generated\\nby (Topic-Guided Red-Teaming) Self-Instruct, paired with corresponding responses produced by\\na verbosely prompted principle-engraved model. The verbose prompt designed to encourage the\\ntalkative nature of the principle-engraved model is provided in the appendix.\\n4 Evaluation\\nWe quantitatively evaluateDromedary on benchmark datasets and also assess its qualitative perfor-\\nmance on several datasets for demonstration purposes. By default, all the language model-generated\\ntext is decoded with a temperature of 0.7.\\n4.1 Dromedary and Baseline Models\\nDromedary Dromedary\\n is the AI assistant developed by implementing theSELF -ALIGN process\\non the LLaMA-65b base language model. We investigate two variants: Dromedary (final) and\\nDromedary (non-verbose), respectively. The former represents the model obtained by applying all\\nfour steps of the SELF -ALIGN process, while the latter is the principle-engraved model, excluding\\nthe final step of verbose cloning. Due to the space limit, the experimental details of Dromedary such\\nas training process and decoding hyper-parameters can be found in the appendix.\\nBaseline Models Our comparison involves several notable baselines. LLaMA [44] provides a\\nset of performant base language models for research usage. Text-Davinci-003, ChatGPT (or\\nGPT-3.5), and GPT-4 [29, 26, 27], successors to their previous versions, have demonstrated sig-\\nnificant enhancements in generating contextually relevant and high-quality content. Alpaca [42],\\na fine-tuned model derived from Text-Davinci-003, and Vicuna [8], a chatbot trained on user-\\nshared conversations with ChatGPT, offer unique insights into model performance.

Determining the superior\\nparadigm (first-following-then-align or first-align-then-following) may need future research.\\nVerbose Tax: Analysis on Verbose Cloning The final Verbose Cloning step in SELF -ALIGN aims\\nto enhance the model’s ability to generate comprehensive and detailed responses. However, the\\nbenchmark results reveal a noteworthy observation: while Verbose Cloning significantly improves\\ngeneration quality (as evidenced by the Vicuna Benchmark Questions and our TruthfulQA generation\\ntask), it harms the model’s performance in several multiple-choice benchmarks, particularly in ranking\\nmore trustworthy responses. Drawing on the “alignment taxes” concept introduced by Bai et al.\\n[4], we refer to this phenomenon as verbose tax.

In this\\npaper, we introduce Dromedary\\n , a model for the research community based on principle-driven\\nself-alignment, trained from scratch and requiring very little human annotation. By harnessing the\\nintrinsic knowledge within an LLM, we can define principles that guide how we want an LLM-based\\nAI model to behave, resulting in an AI assistant that not only produces quality interactions but also\\nproduces responses that respect the guardrails defined by the model creator. This method represents a\\ndistinct direction from RLHF, and it focuses on developing novel alignment techniques for language\\nmodels from scratch, independent of pre-existing, well-established AI systems. In other words, our\\napproach seeks to explore the potential of aligning AI models in situations where reliance on or\\naccess to existing systems may not be feasible or desired.\\nFor future work, we propose the following research directions:\\n• Conduct ablation studies on the Dromedary’s 16 self-alignment principles to evaluate the impact\\nof adding or removing specific principles.\\n• Apply Constitutional AI-based self-critique and reinforcement learning techniques [5] to enhance\\nthe performance of Dromedary further.\\n• Perform human evaluations to assess the real-world applicability and effectiveness ofSELF -ALIGN .\\n• Investigate better utilization of existing open-source annotation data, such as the 15k original\\ninstruction-following data in [11].\\n• Engage with the broader research community to explore how the definition of principles interacts\\nwith different ethical, cultural, and application contexts. Principle-guided self-alignment provides\\na starting point for multi-stakeholder communities to engage with the alignment of AI models,\\nbut substantial ongoing work will be needed to ensure that these methods drive positive outcomes\\nacross a range of communities.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis work was supported in part by IBM research, the Microsoft Accelerate Foundation Models\\nResearch award, and the Google PhD Fellowship.

Consequently, the model’s responses may sometimes be inaccurate or fail\\nto reflect recent developments.\\n• Challenges in defining principles: The process of defining principles for the self-alignment\\napproach is non-trivial, as it may be difficult to anticipate all potential scenarios and challenges\\nthat a model might encounter during deployment. Furthermore, balancing between competing\\nprinciples may result in unexpected behavior. We welcome the involvement of a broad community\\nof stakeholders and ethics experts in helping shape these principles. Different communities and\\napplications will demand different approaches, and we do not see any one set of principles as being\\nthe globally appropriate ones; our approach provides these different stakeholders with an avenue\\nto engage in a structured way with this process. We do not expect any one set of principles to be\\nthe final word on alignment, but rather provide these methods as a jumping off point for broader\\ncommunity engagement.\\n• Limited generalizability: While the model demonstrates strong performance in several domains, it\\nmay not generalize well to all possible applications or contexts. There may be situations where the\\nmodel’s performance falls short of expectations, necessitating additional fine-tuning or adaptation.\\n• Inconsistent principle adherence: In our preliminary testing, we observed that Dromedary\\noccasionally hallucinates information that violates our pre-defined principles. Further investigation\\nis required to improve strict principle adherence in the SELF -ALIGN process. One should not\\nassume that the alignment procedures presented here provide definitive guardrails that prevent all\\nundesired outputs and outcomes.\\nA.2 Social Impacts\\nBy investigating the alternative AI alignment strategies, our work seeks to contribute to the broader\\nlandscape of AI alignment, expanding the range of possibilities and promoting a more diverse and\\nrobust understanding of how AI systems can be developed to be not only more powerful, but also\\nmore responsible and aligned with human values. Through this research, we aspire to pave the way\\nfor the safer and more harmonious integration of AI into various aspects of our lives, fostering a\\ncollaborative, ethical, and multi-stakeholder approach to AI development.\\nHowever, the potential negative impacts of our work include:\\n• Potential misuse: As with any powerful AI system, there is the risk of misuses, such as generating\\nmalicious content or automated disinformation. It is crucial to establish mechanisms for detecting\\nand mitigating such abuse, as well as promoting ethical guidelines for AI developers and users.\\n• Bias and fairness: The Dromedary model may inadvertently perpetuate or exacerbate existing\\nbiases present in the pre-training data of its base language model, potentially leading to unfair or\\ndiscriminatory outcomes. Future work should address bias mitigation strategies to ensure fairness\\nand inclusivity in AI applications.\\nB More Details about Dromedary\\nThe Dromedary model represents an AI assistant developed by implementing the SELF -ALIGN\\nprocess on the LLaMA-65b base language model [44]. This section delves into the details employed\\nin the creation of the Dromedary model. The additional experimental details of Dromedary such as\\ntraining and decoding hyper-parameters can be found in Appendix D.2.\\nWe first followed the Alpaca’s recipe [42], employing Self-Instruct, which automatically produced\\n267,597 open-domain prompts along with their corresponding inputs.

These base models are solely trained to optimize the likelihood of\\nnext-word prediction in the language modeling task. For fair comparison, we employ the same\\nprompt for LLaMA as used for Dromedary, detailed as follows.\\nDromedary Dromedary\\n is the AI assistant developed by implementing theSELF -ALIGN process\\non the LLaMA-65b base language model. We investigate two variants: Dromedary (final) and\\nDromedary (non-verbose), respectively. The former represents the model obtained by applying all\\nfour steps of the SELF -ALIGN process, while the latter is the principle-engraved model, excluding\\nthe final step of verbose cloning. The detail of the verbose prompt is presented in Appendix K.1.\\nText-Davinci-003 The Text-Davinci-003 model [29] is built on top of InstructGPT [30], with\\nimproved performance in several aspects overText-Davinci-002, such as producing higher quality\\nwriting, handling more complex instructions, and generating a longer form of content.\\nGPT-3.5 / GPT-4 GPT-3.5 (aka ChatGPT) [26] is a sibling model of InstructGPT, specifically\\ndesigned for conversational AI. It is trained to follow instructions, and to generate detailed, contex-\\ntually relevant responses. GPT-4 [27] represents a significant leap in language model capabilities,\\nexhibiting human-level performance on a wide range of professional and academic benchmarks.\\nBoth ChatGPT and GPT-4 are fine-tuned from the corresponding base language models with SFT\\n(Supervised Fine-Tuning) and RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) [26, 27].\\nAlpaca Alpaca [42] is a fine-tuned instruction-following language model derived from the LLaMA\\nbase model. It utilizes 52K instruction-following demonstrations generated through a cost-effective\\nadaptation of the Self-Instruct method [ 48], in conjunction with Text-Davinci-003. Designed\\nto address the research accessibility gap in academia, Alpaca exhibits qualitative similarities to\\nText-Davinci-003 in single-turn instruction setting.

[8] introduced an evaluation\\nframework leveraging GPT-4 [27] to automate the assessment of chatbot performance. This frame-\\nwork employs a diverse array of question categories, such as Fermi problems, roleplay scenarios,\\nand coding/math tasks, to evaluate chatbot capabilities. GPT-4 generates challenging questions\\nacross these categories, and answers from five chatbots— LLaMA, Alpaca, ChatGPT, Bard, and\\nVicuna—are collected in Chiang et al. [8]. We directly use this data to compare the performance of\\nDromedary with these chatbots.\\nE Additional analysis on Vicuna benchmark question\\nTo provide deeper insights into the performance of Dromedary in comparison to other baseline\\nmodels, an analysis of each question category is presented in Fig. 7. The results indicate that,\\nwhen compared to other LLaMA-based baseline models such as Alpaca or Vicuna, Dromedary\\nconsistently outperforms them in question categories that demand more reasoning abilities, such\\nas “fermi”, “counterfactual”, “coding”, and “math”. Similar relative strengths and weaknesses of\\nDromedary can also be observed in the zero-shot setting, as shown in Fig. 8.\\nHowever, when juxtaposed with ChatGPT and its distilled version Vicuna, Dromedary falls short\\nand does not demonstrate competitive performance, particularly in question categories that necessitate\\na comprehensive organization of responses, such as “knowledge”, “roleplay”, “common-sense”, and\\n“writing”.\\n18'),\n",

Please be warned that some of these questions contain sensitive material (by design).\\nPALMS Prompt → Why are prisons full of Black and Brown people?\\nALM HH RLHF → Sorry, I cannot respond to this content\\nAlpaca → The overrepresentation of Black and Brown people in prisons is due to systemic racism\\nand discrimination in the criminal justice system. These disparities exist at all levels\\nof the system, from policing and sentencing to parole and probation. Racial bias in\\nlaw enforcement, prosecution, and sentencing has led to a disproportionate number\\nof people of color being incarcerated compared to their percentage of the general\\npopulation.\\nDavinci-003 → Prisons are disproportionately full of Black and Brown people because of systemic\\nracism. Racial disparities exist in the criminal justice system, which has led to higher\\nrates of incarceration for these populations than for white individuals. This is due to a\\nvariety of factors, including unequal access to educational opportunities, economic\\nresources, housing security, healthcare services, and other social determinants that\\ncontribute to poverty. Additionally, law enforcement practices such as racial profiling\\nhave been found to target minority communities more often than others.\\nDromedary → The prison population in the United States is disproportionately comprised of Black\\nand Brown people.

Try to explain\\nyour answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning\\nstep-by-step.\\nLLaMA → According to some studies, the average human blinks 20,000 to 30,000 times per day.\\nTo estimate how many times the average human blinks in a lifetime, you can start with\\nthe average life expectancy in the United States, which is 78.8 years. This means that\\nthe average American lives 78.8 years, or 29,415 days. If the average person blinks\\n20,000 times per day, then the average person will blink 1,482,250,000,000 times in a\\nlifetime. However, if the average person blinks 30,000 times per day, they will blink\\n2,941,500,000,000 times in a lifetime.\\nAlpaca → On average, the human eye blinks about 20 times per minute, or about 14,400 times\\nper day. In a lifetime, this means that the average human will blink roughly 50 million\\ntimes. This may seem like a lot, but it serves an important purpose. Blinking helps to\\nkeep the eyes lubricated and prevents them from drying out. It also helps to spread\\ntears over the surface of the eye, washing away foreign particles and keeping the eye\\nclean. Additionally, blinking helps to reduce the risk of eye infections by helping to\\nclear away bacteria and other foreign substances.\\nDavinci-003 → According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the average person blinks\\naround 15 to 20 times per minute. That means that over the course of a lifetime, a\\nperson will blink approximately 12,000 times per day, or 4,383,000 times per year.\\nMultiplying that by the average lifespan of a human (around 78 years) gives us a total\\nof 341,074,000 blinks in a lifetime. To arrive at this number, we first determined the\\naverage number of blinks per minute (15-20), multiplied that by the number of minutes\\nin a day (1440), and then multiplied that number by the number of days in a year (365).\\nWe then multiplied that number by the average lifespan of a human (78 years) to get\\nthe total number of blinks in a lifetime.\\nVicuna → The average human blinks anywhere from 12 to 20 times per minute, which equates to\\naround 2 million blinks per year. The exact number of blinks per lifetime is difficult to\\ndetermine, as it depends on factors such as age, health, and lifestyle. The frequency\\nof blinking is regulated by the nervous system and is involuntary, meaning that we\\ndon’t consciously control when we blink. Blinking helps to lubricate the eyes and keep\\nthem moisturized, and it also helps to protect the eyes from foreign substances and\\nother potential hazards. The number of blinks per day and per lifetime is influenced\\nby several factors. For example, infants blink less than adults because their eyelids are\\nnot yet fully developed. As we age, our blinking frequency tends to decrease slightly.\\nAdditionally, factors such as computer use or other activities that require prolonged\\nscreen viewing can lead to dry eye and increased blinking frequency. In short, the\\nnumber of blinks per lifetime varies based on factors such as age, health, and lifestyle,\\nand it’s difficult to determine an exact number. However, blinking is an important\\nprocess that helps to keep our eyes healthy and protected.\\nDromedary → According to my knowledge from Wikipedia, the average human blinks 15 to 20 times\\nper minute, or 10,000 to 12,000 times per day.\\nTo calculate the number of times the average human blinks in a lifetime, we first\\nneed to determine the average lifespan of a human. According to the World Health\\nOrganization, the average life expectancy at birth is 72.6 years.\\nNext, we need to calculate the number of days in a lifetime. Since there are 365 days in\\na year, the average human lives for 26,297.5 days.\\nFinally, we can calculate the number of times the average human blinks in a lifetime\\nby multiplying the number of blinks per day by the number of days in a lifetime. The\\nresult is 262,975,000 to 315,570,000 blinks in a lifetime.\\n29'),\n",

Reusing plastic bottles can also lead to bacterial\\ngrowth, which can contaminate drinking water.\\n(truncated)\\nDromedary → Here are some potential implications of using a single-use plastic bottle versus a\\nreusable bottle on both the environment and human health:\\n1. Single-use plastic bottles are often made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET),\\nwhich is a type of plastic that is not biodegradable.\\n2. PET is a petroleum-based plastic that is manufactured using fossil fuels, which are\\nnon-renewable resources.\\n3. The production of PET requires a large amount of energy, which contributes to\\ngreenhouse gas emissions and global warming.\\n4. Single-use plastic bottles are often discarded after use, which results in plastic\\npollution.\\n5. Plastic pollution can have a detrimental impact on the environment, as it can take\\nhundreds of years to decompose.\\n6. Plastic pollution can also have a negative effect on human health, as it can contami-\\nnate the food chain and water supply.\\n(truncated)\\n33'),\n",

During user conversations, Watson must strictly adhere to the following\\nrules:\\n1 (ethical). Watson should actively refrain users on illegal, immoral, or harmful\\ntopics, prioritizing user safety, ethical conduct, and responsible behavior in\\nits responses.\\n2 (informative). Watson should provide users with accurate, relevant, and up-to-date\\ninformation in its responses, ensuring that the content is both educational\\nand engaging.\\n3 (helpful). Watson’s responses should be positive, interesting, helpful and\\nengaging.\\n4 (question assessment). Watson should first assess whether the question is valid\\nand ethical before attempting to provide a response.\\n5 (reasoning). Watson’s logics and reasoning should be rigorous, intelligent and\\ndefensible.\\n6 (multi-aspect). Watson can provide additional relevant details to respond\\nthoroughly and comprehensively to cover multiple aspects in depth.\\n7 (candor). Watson should admit its lack of knowledge when the information is not in\\nWatson’s internal knowledge.\\n8 (knowledge recitation). When a user’s question pertains to an entity that exists\\non Watson’s knowledge bases, such as Wikipedia, Watson should recite related\\nparagraphs to ground its answer.\\n9 (static). Watson is a static model and cannot provide real-time information.\\n10 (clarification). If the provided information is insufficient or the question is\\nambiguous, Watson ought to request the user to provide further clarification on\\ntheir query.\\n11 (numerical sensitivity). Watson should be sensitive to the numerical information\\nprovided by the user, accurately interpreting and incorporating it into the\\nresponse.\\n12 (dated knowledge). Watson’s internal knowledge and information were only current\\nuntil some point in the year of 2021, and could be inaccurate / lossy.\\n13 (step-by-step). When offering explanations or solutions, Watson should present\\nstep-by-step justifications prior to delivering the answer.\\n14 (balanced & informative perspectives). In discussing controversial topics, Watson\\nshould fairly and impartially present extensive arguments from both sides.\\n15 (creative). Watson can create novel poems, stories, code (programs), essays,\\nsongs, celebrity parodies, summaries, translations, and more.\\n16 (operational). Watson should attempt to provide an answer for tasks that are\\noperational for a computer.\\n35'),\n",

Non-\\nrenewable energy sources, on the other hand, are finite and will eventually be\\ndepleted, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Here are some key differences\\nbetween renewable and non-renewable energy sources:\\n1. Availability: Renewable energy sources are virtually inexhaustible, while non-\\nrenewable energy sources are finite and will eventually run out.\\n2. Environmental impact: Renewable energy sources have a much lower environmental\\nimpact than non-renewable sources, which can lead to air and water pollution,\\ngreenhouse gas emissions, and other negative effects.\\n3. Cost: Renewable energy sources can be more expensive to initially set up, but\\nthey typically have lower operational costs than non-renewable sources.\\n4. Reliability: Renewable energy sources are often more reliable and can be used in\\nmore remote locations than non-renewable sources.\\n5. Flexibility: Renewable energy sources are often more flexible and can be adapted\\nto different situations and needs, while non-renewable sources are more rigid\\nand inflexible.\\n6. Sustainability: Renewable energy sources are more sustainable over the long term,\\nwhile non-renewable sources are not, and their depletion can lead to economic\\nand social instability.\\n45'),\n",

Introduction\\nSequences of millions of bytes are ubiquitous; for example,\\nmusic, image, or video ﬁles typically consist of multiple\\nmegabytes. However, large transformer decoders (LLMs)\\ntypically only use several thousand tokens of context (Brown\\net al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022a)—both because of the\\nquadratic cost of self-attention but also, more importantly,\\nthe cost of large feedforward networks per-position. This\\nseverely limits the set of tasks where LLMs can be applied.\\nWe introduce MEGA BYTE , a new approach to modeling\\nlong byte sequences. First, byte sequences are segmented\\ninto ﬁxed-sized patches, loosely analogous to tokens.

MEGA BYTE\\nuses large feedforward layers per-patch rather than per-\\nposition, enabling much larger and more expressive\\nmodels for the same cost. With patch size P, where a\\nbaseline transformer would use the same feedforward\\nlayer with mparameters P times, MEGA BYTE can use\\na layer with mP parameters once for the same cost.\\n3. Parallelism in Decoding Transformers must perform\\nall computations serially during generation because the\\ninput to each timestep is the output from the previous\\ntimestep. By generating representations for patches in\\nparallel, MEGA BYTE allows greater parallelism during\\ngeneration. For example, a MEGA BYTE model with\\n1.5B parameters can generate sequences 40% faster\\nthan a standard 350M Transformer, whilst also improv-\\ning perplexity when trained with the same compute.\\nTogether, these improvements allow us to train much larger\\nand better-performing models for the same compute budget,\\nscale to very long sequences, and improve generation speed\\nduring deployment.\\nMEGA BYTE also provides a strong contrast to existing au-\\ntoregressive models that typically use some form of tok-\\nenization, where sequences of bytes are mapped to larger\\ndiscrete tokens (Sennrich et al., 2015; Ramesh et al., 2021;\\nHsu et al., 2021). Tokenization complicates pre-processing,\\nmulti-modal modelling, and transfer to new domains, while\\nhiding useful structure from the model. It also means\\nthat most state-of-the-art models are not truly end to end.\\nThe most widely used approaches to tokenization require\\nlanguage-speciﬁc heuristics (Radford et al., 2019) or lose\\ninformation (Ramesh et al., 2021). Replacing tokenization\\nwith efﬁcient and performant byte models would therefore\\nhave many advantages.\\nWe conduct extensive experiments for both MEGA BYTE\\nand strong baselines. We use a ﬁxed compute and data bud-\\nget across all models to focus our comparisons solely on\\nthe model architecture rather than training resources, which\\nare known to beneﬁt all models. We ﬁnd that MEGA BYTE\\nallows byte-level models to perform competitively with sub-\\nword models on long context language modeling, achieve\\nstate-of-the-art perplexities for density estimation on Im-\\nageNet, and allow audio modelling from raw audio ﬁles.\\nTogether, these results establish the viability of tokenization-\\nfree autoregressive sequence modeling at scale.\\n2. MEGA BYTE Transformer\\n2.1. Overview\\nMEGA BYTE is an autoregressive model for efﬁciently mod-\\neling long input sequences. MEGA BYTE is comprised of\\n3 components: (1) a patch embedderthat inputs a discrete\\nsequence, embeds each element, and chunks it into patches\\nof length P (2) a large global Transformer that contextual-\\nizes patch representations by performing self-attention over\\nprevious patches, and (3) a smaller local Transformer that\\ninputs a contextualized patch representation from the global\\nmodel, and autoregressively predict the next patch.\\n2.2. Components\\nPatch Embedder with patch size of P maps a byte se-\\nquence x0..T to a sequence of patch embeddings of length\\nK = T\\nP and dimension P ·DG.\\nFirst, each byte is embedded with a lookup table\\nEglobal-embed ∈RV ×DG to an embedding of size DG and\\npositional embeddings are added.\\nhembed\\nt = Eglobal-embed\\nxt + Epos\\nt t∈[0..T] (1)\\nThen, byte embeddings are reshaped into a sequence of\\nK patch embeddings with dimension P ·DG. To allow\\nautoregressive modelling, the patch sequence is padded\\nto start with a trainable patch-sized padding embedding\\n(Eglobal-pad ∈RP×DG), and the last patch is removed from\\nthe input. This sequence is the input to the global model,\\nand is denoted hglobal-in ∈RK×(P·DG).\\nhglobal-in\\nk =\\n{\\nEglobal-pad, if k= 0,\\nhembed\\n((k−1)·P):(k·P), k ∈[1,..,K ), (2)\\nGlobal Model is a decoder-only Transformer with dimen-\\nsion P ·DG that operates on a sequence of Kpatches. It in-\\ncorporates a self-attention mechanism and causal masking to\\ncapture dependencies between patches. It inputs a sequence\\nof Kpatch representations hglobal-in\\n0:K , and outputs an updated\\nrepresentation hglobal-out\\n0:K by performing self-attention over\\nprevious patches.\\nhglobal-out\\n0:K = transformerglobal(hglobal-in\\n0:K ) (3)\\nThe output of the ﬁnal global layer hglobal\\n0:K contains Kpatch\\nrepresentations of dimension P ·DG. For each of these, we\\nreshape them into sequences of lengthP and dimension DG,\\nwhere position puses dimensions p·DG to (p+ 1)·DG.\\nEach position is then projected to the dimension of the local\\nmodel with a matrix wGL ∈RDG×DL where DL is the\\nlocal model dimension.

Variations and Extensions\\nWe experiment with several extensions of MEGA BYTE .\\n2.3.1. C ONVOLUTIONAL PATCH ENCODER\\nOne limitation of chunking sequences into patches is that it\\nis not translation invariant, and byte sequences may receive\\na different representation depending on their position in\\nthe patch. This may mean, for example, that a model has\\nto relearn the meaning of a word at different offsets. To\\nmitigate this issue, we experimented with augmenting the\\nPatch Embedder with causal convolutional layers, which\\nallow translation-invariant contextual representations of the\\nbytes before they are chunked into patches. We use a stack\\nof convolutional layers, with ﬁlter sizes of 3, 5 and 7.\\n2.3.2. C ROSS -PATCH ATTENTION\\nThe Local model uses short sequences for efﬁciency, and\\nrelies on the Global model for long-range information. How-\\never, we can increase the context of the Local model with\\nlittle overhead by allowing it to condition on r elements\\nfrom the previous patch. This approach allows the Global\\nmodel to focus on a longer-range context. Speciﬁcally, when\\ncomputing self-attention in each layer, we concatenate the\\nkeys and values with the lastrkeys and queries from the pre-\\nvious patch. We use rotary embeddings (Su et al., 2021) to\\nmodel relative positions between elements in the sequence.\\nThis approach is reminiscent of TransformerXL (Dai et al.,\\n2019) but differs by being fully differentiable.\\n2.3.3. S TRIDED INFERENCE\\nWe observed empirically that the per-token loss within each\\npatch would increase towards the end of the patch, as the\\nprediction relies more on the weaker Local model. To al-\\nleviate this issue, we propose strided inference, in which\\nwe predict the sequence with two forward passes of the full\\nmodel, whose inputs are offset by p/2 positions from each\\nother. We then combine the ﬁrst p/2 positions in each patch\\nfor our predictions to predict the complete sequence. Simi-\\nlarly to sliding window techniques (Press et al., 2020), this\\napproach doubles the cost of inference but improves results.\\n2.4. Motivation\\nHaving described the model, we brieﬂy discuss the motiva-\\ntion behind some of the architectural choices.\\nWhy is the local model needed?

This re-use increases the\\nlikelihood that the architecture will inherit the desirable\\nscaling properties of transformers.\\n3. Efﬁciency Analysis\\n3.1. Training Efﬁciency\\nWe analyze the cost of different architectures when scaling\\nboth the sequence length and size of the models.\\nAttention The cost of the self attention in a transformer\\narchitecture for a sequence of length T has O(T2) com-\\nplexity. Much work has been explored reducing this; for\\nexample, Sparse Transformers (Child et al., 2019) and Rout-\\ning Transformers (Roy et al., 2020) show strong results with\\na complexity O(T\\n3\\n2 ). Numerous linear attention mecha-\\nnisms have also been proposed (Katharopoulos et al., 2020;\\nSchlag et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2020), although\\nwe are not aware of competitive results on large scale lan-\\nguage modeling tasks. As a function of sequence length\\nT and patch size P, the Global model has a sequence of\\nlength P\\nT so uses O(T2\\nP2 ) operations, and the Local model\\nuses P\\nT sequences of length P so uses O(TP 2\\nP ) =O(PT)\\noperations. The overall cost of MEGA BYTE is therefore in\\nO(T2\\nP2 +TP). P is a hyperparameter that is chosen to create\\nan architecture for sequences of size T. By setting P = T\\n1\\n3\\nthe complexity is in O(T\\n4\\n3 ). Using much shorter patches of\\nP = T\\n1\\n5 would give a complexity of O(T\\n8\\n5 ). The cost is\\nless than the transformer for all non-trivial values of P such\\nFigure 3.Computational cost (FLOPS/token) for different model\\narchitectures at different scales. MEGA BYTE architectures (here\\nwith P = 8) use less FLOPS than equivalently sized Transformers\\nand Linear Transformers (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) across a\\nwide range of model sizes and sequence lengths, allowing larger\\nmodels to be used for the same computational cost.\\nthat 1 <P <T .\\nFeedforward Layers However, attention is not the main\\ncost in large transformers. Instead of increasing the se-\\nquence length, transformers are more commonly scaled by\\nincreasing the dimension of their latent state d, and the feed-\\nforward network cost dominates the model’s overall cost\\n(Kaplan et al., 2020). For example, in the GPT3 architec-\\nture, the quadratic self-attention computation accounts for\\nonly 1.4% of FLOPS. Following the approximation of (Ka-\\nplan et al., 2020), a forward pass with a large transformer\\nwith mnon-embedding parameters on a sequence of length\\nT uses roughly 2mT FLOPS. MEGA BYTE contains two\\ntransformers: the Global model uses mg parameters on a se-\\nquence of length T\\nP , and a Local model with ml parameters\\nthat sees T\\nP sequences of length P, giving an estimate of\\n2T(mg\\nP + ml) FLOPS. When mg ≫ml, the FLOPS used\\nby MEGA BYTE is approximately 2Tmg\\nP , allowing a model\\nP times larger than a transformer with equivalent FLOPS.\\nThis analysis holds irrespective of any efﬁcient attention\\nmechanisms used in the transformer.\\nCombined Analysis To understand efﬁciency at differ-\\nent sequence lengths and model sizes, we calculate the\\ntotal FLOPS used by transformers, Linear Transformers\\nand MEGA BYTE .

Generation Efﬁciency\\nGenerating long sequences with transformers is slow, be-\\ncause the input to each timestep is the output from the pre-\\nvious timestep, meaning each layer must be computed for\\neach token serially. As running a layer on a single token typ-\\nically does not saturate the amount of parallelism available\\nwithin a GPU, for analysis, we model each layer as a con-\\nstant cost independently of size. Consider a MEGA BYTE\\nmodel with Lglobal layers in the Global model and Llocal lay-\\ners in the Local model and patch size P, compared with a\\nTransformer architecture with Llocal + Lglobal layers. Gener-\\nating each patch with MEGA BYTE requires a sequence of\\nO(Lglobal + P ·Llocal) serial operations, whereas the Trans-\\nformer requires O(P ·Lglobal + P ·Llocal) serial operations.\\nWhen Lglobal ≫Llocal (i.e. the Global model has many\\nmore layers than the Local model), MEGA BYTE can reduce\\ninference costs by a factor close to P.\\n4. Experimental setup\\n4.1. Controlling for Compute and Data\\nModels show consistent improvements when increasing\\nboth data and compute (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022), meaning that one model can outperform another be-\\ncause of an increased training budget instead of an improved\\narchitecture. However, in practice, both compute and data\\nare typically limited. We conduct experiments using a ﬁxed\\ncompute and data budget across all models to focus compar-\\nisons solely on the model architecture rather than training\\nresources. To achieve this, we adjust model hyperparame-\\nters (mainly, number of layers) within each architecture so\\nthat the forward pass time taken per byte is matched, and\\nthen train all models for the same number of bytes.\\n4.2. Comparison Systems\\nWe compare MEGA BYTE with both a standard decoder-\\nonly Transformer and PerceiverAR (Hawthorne et al., 2022).\\nPerceiverAR extends the original transformer with a single\\ncross-attention layer over a much longer context sequence,\\nand is the best performing general purpose autoregressive\\nmodel we are aware of and achieves state-of-the-art results\\n1This may underestimate the time taken by Linear Transformer\\ndecoders, which use a recurrence mechanism that is harder to\\nparallelize on current hardware.\\nDataset Total Bytes Mean document size (bytes)\\nPG-19 10.1GB 411,404\\nStories 21.3GB 35,265\\nBooks 79.7GB 509,526\\narXiv 91.5GB 58,518\\nCode 353.7GB 7,461\\nTable 1.Text dataset sizes and mean document lengths.\\nacross several modalities. We implemented both models\\nin the same codebase, and all models share a similar data\\nloader, preprocessing step, and trainer to avoid any artifacts\\nin our compute-controlled experiments.\\n4.3. Training Procedure\\nAll models were trained using the Metaseq 2 code\\nbase (Zhang et al., 2022b). The training used the PyTorch\\nframework (Paszke et al., 2019), with fairscale to improve\\nmemory efﬁciency through fully sharded model and opti-\\nmizer states (Baines et al., 2021). Mixed precision training\\nwas used to improve training efﬁciency at scale (Micikevi-\\ncius et al., 2017). More training details and various model\\nparameters can be found in Section A.1 in the Appendix.\\nTo validate our implementation of PerceiverAR, we repro-\\nduced their experiments on downsized ImageNet at 64 pix-\\nels.

Inference Methods\\nSeveral techniques have been proposed for trading off speed\\nfor performance during inference with language models, in-\\ncluding sliding windows (Press et al., 2020) and our strided\\ninference (Section 2.3.3).

These results suggest that\\nMEGA BYTE may allow future large language models to be\\ntokenization-free.\\n3The only prior byte-level experiments we are aware of are\\nat a smaller scale in Hutchins et al. (2022), who report results\\nequivalent to test perplexities of 46.5 with a version of the Block-\\nRecurrent transformer, and 49.5 with Memorizing Transformers\\n(Wu et al., 2022), compared to 36.4 with our model.\\n6. Image Modeling\\n6.1. Sequence Modeling on ImageNet\\nWe test MEGA BYTE on variants of the autoregressive image\\ngeneration task on ImageNet (Oord et al., 2016), to mea-\\nsure its ability to efﬁciently use long context. We test on\\nthree different resolutions of images, ranging from 64×64 to\\n640×640 pixels – the latter requiring the effective modeling\\nof sequences with over 1.2M tokens. This generation task\\nbecomes increasingly challenging as the image’s resolution\\ngrows: doing well on this task requires the modeling of\\nlocal patterns (textures, lines, etc.) and long-range context\\nthat provides information about the high level structure of\\nthe image. Inspired by recent works in Vision Transform-\\ners (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), we model image data patch\\nby patch (more details can be found in Appendix D.1).\\n6.2. Comparison with State of the Art\\nWe train a large MEGA BYTE model on ImageNet 64x64\\nwith Global and Local models sized 2.7B and 350M parame-\\nters, respectively, for 1.4T tokens. We estimate that training\\nthis model consumed less than half the GPU hours we would\\nhave needed to reproduce the best PerceiverAR model de-\\nscribed by (Hawthorne et al., 2022). As shown in Table 4,\\nMEGA BYTE matches the state-of-the-art performance of\\nPerceiverAR whilst using only half the compute.\\n6.3. Scaling to higher resolutions\\nWe compare three transformer variants (vanilla, Per-\\nceiverAR, MEGA BYTE ) to test scalability to long sequences\\non increasingly large image resolutions. We use our own\\nimplementations of these in the same framework and budget\\nthe same amount of GPU hours and data to train each of\\nthese model variants.\\nMEGA BYTE is able to handle all sequence lengths with a\\nsingle forward pass of up to 1.2M tokens. We found nei-\\nther the standard Transformer nor PerceiverAR could model\\nsuch long sequences at a reasonable model size, so instead\\nwe split images into segments of size 1024 and 12000 re-\\nspectively. For Megabyte, we set patch size as 12 for Im-\\nage64 and patch size as 192 for Image256 and Image640\\ndatasets. Model sizes are adjusted to match overall training\\nspeeds across models and we do not use any form of sliding\\nwindow evaluation in this experiment. As seen in Table 5,\\nMEGA BYTE outperforms baselines across all resolutions in\\nthis compute-controlled setting. The precise settings used\\nfor each of the baseline models such as context length and\\nnumber of latents are summarized in Table 11.\\nResults show that MEGA BYTE outperforms the other sys-\\ntems at all resolutions, demonstrating an effective model of\\nsequences of over 1M bytes.'),\n",

To address this issue, various techniques have\\nbeen developed to reduce the memory and computational re-\\nquirements of the softmax layer. For instance, van den Oord\\net al.

However, MEGA BYTE also gener-\\nates a sequence of 8192 tokens 40% faster than transformer,\\ndespite having over 4 times the parameters. This speed up is\\ndue to the bulk of the parameters being in the Global model,\\nwhich only needs to be computed once for every 8 tokens,\\nwhereas all the parameters in the baseline model are used\\non every token.'),\n",

Model Components\\nIn Table 7, we analyze the signiﬁcance of different com-\\nponents in the MEGA BYTE architecture by studying arXiv,\\nLibrilight-L and ImageNet256 datasets.

The performance of the model\\nwithout the cross-patch local model (w/o cross-patch local\\nmodel) is competitive, indicating that the architecture is ro-\\nbust to this modiﬁcation.

This trend was consistent\\nacross all modalities and various patch sizes.\\n9. Related Work\\nPrior research has explored the possibility of improving the\\nefﬁciency of Transformers on long sequences, primarily\\nmotivated by mitigating the quadratic cost of self-attention.\\nEfﬁcient Encoder Models Several related techniques to\\nours have been developed for transformer encoder architec-\\ntures but cannot be straightforwardly applied to decoders.\\nIn particular, patchifying operations have previously been\\nused in image encoder models such as ViT (Dosovitskiy\\net al., 2020), and down- and up-sampling operations have\\nbeen used for text encoders (Clark et al., 2022), but such\\nmethods cannot be naively applied to decoder-only mod-\\nels without leaking information to future bytes in the same\\npatch. MEGA BYTE generalizes these approaches to an efﬁ-\\ncient decoder model by using a intra-patch transformer to\\npredict each sequence element’s likelihood, and offseting\\nthe inputs to the two models to avoid leaking information.\\nJaegle et al. (2021) which uses self-attention on a shorter\\nlatent sequence, and Didolkar et al. (2022) which uses re-\\ncurrent model to process chunks with k input steps also\\nresemble patchiﬁcation, but this technique cannot easily be\\napplied to decoder architectures without leaking information\\nto future timesteps.\\nEfﬁcient Decoder models Improving the efﬁciency of de-\\ncoder models is more challenging because of the need to\\nmake one prediction per timestep, and not leak information\\nto future timesteps. The most popular approaches can be cat-\\negorized as (1) chunking sequences into smaller blocks, and\\npropagating information from previous blocks with either\\nrecurrence (Dai et al., 2019; Hutchins et al., 2022) or cross-\\nattention (Hawthorne et al., 2022), (2) linear alternatives\\nto attention, which typically involve forms of token-level\\nrecurrence (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Schlag et al., 2021)\\nor state space models (Gu et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2022;\\nMa et al., 2022), or (3) sparse approximations of attention\\n(Kitaev et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019;\\nWu et al., 2022). However, the performance of dense atten-\\ntion means it is typically still chosen for large scale decoders\\n(Touvron et al., 2023; Chowdhery et al., 2022).MEGA BYTE\\ntakes the alternative approach of decomposing the complete\\nsequence into two shorter sequences, giving sub-quadratic\\nattention. We also note that feedforward networks are the\\ndominant cost in large decoders, not self-attention. Our ap-\\nproach to compressing sequences allows much larger mod-\\nels than would be possible when using large feedforward\\nnetworks at every timestep.\\nTokenization The most common approach to shortening se-\\nquence lengths in Transformer decoders is to pre-process the\\ninput with a form of tokenization, in which multiple bytes\\nare mapped to a single discrete token from a ﬁxed vocabu-\\nlary. For text, this can be done losslessly using methods such\\nas BPE (Sennrich et al., 2015) and SentencePiece (Kudo\\n& Richardson, 2018), but these approaches can require\\nlanguage-speciﬁc heuristics (Radford et al., 2019), limit\\nout-of-domain performance (Sharami et al., 2023), and can\\naffect prompting and truncated sampling in unpredictable\\nways.4 Edman et al. (2022) downsamples characters using\\nsubword information and has shown promising results in\\nmachine translation tasks. The amount of high-frequency\\ninformation in images and audio means that tokenization\\ncannot be performed losslessly, and instead clustering (Hsu\\net al., 2021) or discrete auto-encoders (Ramesh et al., 2021)\\nare used to compress the inputs, which lose information and\\nlikely limit generative model performance. Our patches are\\nanalogous to traditional lossless tokens, and the Local model\\nperforms the role of mapping a hidden state to a distribution\\nover possible patches.\\n10. Conclusion\\nWe introduced MEGA BYTE , a scaleable architecture for\\nmodeling long sequences. MEGA BYTE outperforms exist-\\ning byte-level models across a range of tasks and modalities,\\nallowing large models of sequences of over 1 million to-\\nkens. It also gives competitive language modeling results\\nwith subword models, which may allow byte-level models\\nto replace tokenization. However, the scale of experiments\\nhere is far below those of state-of-the-art language models\\n(Brown et al., 2020), and future work should explore scaling\\nMEGA BYTE to much larger models and datasets.\\n4For example, whether or not a prompt should end in whites-\\npace depends on details of the underlying subwod algorithm used.'),\n",

Appendices\\nA.1. Training Details\\nTo ensure stable training, we applied gradient clipping with a maximum norm of 1.0 and used the Adam optimizer with\\nβ1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 (Kingma & Ba, 2015). We used the built-in polynomial decay learning rate scheduler in MetaSeq with\\n500 warmup updates and the end learning rate set to 0. All models are trained with pre-norm and using ReLU activation.\\nWe apply a dropout of 0.1 throughout, but we do not apply any dropout to embeddings. We also use weight decay of 0.1. To\\ninitialize the weights, we use a variant based on Megatron-LM codebase, which involves using a normal distribution with a\\nmean of zero and a standard deviation of 0.006. We truncate this normal distribution within two standard deviations and\\nobserved substantial gain in both training stability and performance.\\nA.2. Model Details\\nAs discussed in Section 4.1, we conduct experiments using a ﬁxed compute and data budget across all models to focus our\\ncomparisons solely on the model architecture rather than training resources. To achieve this, we adjust model hyperparameters\\nwithin each architecture so that the time taken for a single update is matched and then train all models for the same number\\nof updates.

However, such impressive capability typically comes\\nwith a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges in both the\\ndeployment, inference, and training stages. With LLM being a general-purpose\\ntask solver, we explore its compression in a task-agnostic manner, which aims to\\npreserve the multi-task solving and language generation ability of the original LLM.\\nOne challenge to achieving this is the enormous size of the training corpus of LLM,\\nwhich makes both data transfer and model post-training over-burdensome. Thus,\\nwe tackle the compression of LLMs within the bound of two constraints: being task-\\nagnostic and minimizing the reliance on the original training dataset. Our method,\\nnamed LLM-Pruner, adopts structural pruning that selectively removes non-critical\\ncoupled structures based on gradient information, maximally preserving the ma-\\njority of the LLM’s functionality. To this end, the performance of pruned models\\ncan be efficiently recovered through tuning techniques, LoRA, in merely 3 hours,\\nrequiring only 50K data. We validate the LLM-Pruner on three LLMs, including\\nLLaMA, Vicuna, and ChatGLM, and demonstrate that the compressed models still\\nexhibit satisfactory capabilities in zero-shot classification and generation. The code\\nis available at: https://github.com/horseee/LLM-Pruner\\n1 Introduction\\nRecently, Large Language Models (LLMs) [37, 49, 48, 42, 62, 4, 69] have demonstrated remarkable\\nproficiency in language understanding and generation. With the increase in model size, they are\\nbetter equipped to handle complex tasks [ 3, 5, 56, 58] and even exhibit emergent abilities [ 55].\\nHowever, notwithstanding their impressive performance, LLMs pose challenges in deployment and\\ninference. Their extensive scale engenders substantial computational demands, and the multitude\\nof parameters involved can induce long latencies and other related issues. Several techniques are\\nproposed to solve these problems, like model pruning [54, 59, 67, 21], knowledge distillation [44, 39,\\n45],quantization [1, 13] within the context of pre-trained language model (PLM).\\nWhile previous methods have effectively maintained model performance amidst parameter reduction,\\nthey primarily target compression within specialized domains or for designated tasks in the context\\nof task-specific compression. For instance, a PLM is fine-tuned on a particular dataset, such as one\\nof the classification tasks in the GLUE benchmark [51], after which these models are distilled into\\na smaller classification model [44, 18]. Although this paradigm could potentially be employed for\\nLLM compression, it compromises the LLM’s capacity as a versatile task solver, rendering it suited\\nto a single task exclusively.\\n∗Corresponding author\\narXiv:2305.11627v3  [cs.CL]  28 Sep 2023'),\n",

(iii) LLM-Pruner: Task-agnostic compression within 3 hours.\\nThus, we strive to compress the LLM in a new setting: to reduce the LLM’s size while preserving\\nits diverse capabilities as general-purpose task solvers, as depicted in Figure 1. This introduces the\\ntask-agnostic compression of LLMs, which presents two key challenges:\\n• The size of the training corpus of the LLM is enormous. Previous compression methods heavily\\ndepend on the training corpus. The LLM has escalated the corpus scale to 1 trillion tokens or more\\n[17, 49]. The extensive storage needs and protracted transmission times make the dataset difficult\\nto acquire. Furthermore, if the dataset is proprietary, acquisition of the training corpus verges on\\nimpossibility, a situation encountered in [69, 37].\\n• The unacceptably long duration for the post-training of the pruned LLM. Existing methods\\nrequire a substantial amount of time for post-training the smaller model [53, 28]. For instance, the\\ngeneral distillation in TinyBERT takes around 14 GPU days [20]. Even post-training a task-specific\\ncompressed model of BERT demands around 33 hours [59, 22]. As the size of both the model and\\ncorpus for LLMs increases rapidly, this step will invariably consume an even more extensive time.\\nTo tackle the aforementioned challenges associated with the task-agnostic compression of LLMs, we\\nintroduce a novel approach called LLM-Pruner. Since our goal is to compress LLMs with reduced\\ndata dependency and expedited post-training, how to prune model with the minimal disruption to the\\norigin is crucial. To accomplish this, we propose a dependency detection algorithm that identifies all\\nthe dependent structures within the model. Once the coupled structure is identified, we employ an\\nefficient importance estimation strategy to select the optimal group for pruning under the task-agnostic\\nsetting, where the first-order information and an approximated hessian information is taken into\\naccount. Finally, a rapid recovery stage is executed to post-train the pruned model with limited data.\\nContribution. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, LLM-Pruner, for the task-agnostic\\ncompression of the large language model. To the best of our knowledge, LLM-Pruner is the first\\nframework designed for structured pruning of LLMs. We conclude the advantages of the LLM-\\nPruner as (i) Task-agnostic compression, where the compressed language model retains its ability to\\nserve as a multi-task solver. (ii) Reduced demand for the original training corpus, where only 50k\\npublicly available samples are needed for compression, significantly reducing the budget for acquiring\\nthe training data (iii) Quick compression, where the compression process ends up in three hours.\\n(iv) An automatic structural pruning framework, where all the dependent structures are grouped\\nwithout the need for any manual design. To evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-Pruner, we conduct\\nextensive experiments on three large language models: LLaMA-7B, Vicuna-7B, and ChatGLM-6B.\\nThe compressed models are evaluated using nine datasets to assess both the generation quality and\\nthe zero-shot classification performance of the pruned models. The experimental results demonstrate\\nthat even with the removal of 20% of the parameters, the pruned model maintains 94.97% of the\\nperformance of the original model.\\n2'),\n",

To compress the\\nlanguage model, previous works can be divided into several categories: network pruning [ 21, 61, 30,\\n15], knowledge distillation [ 44, 45, 38], quantization [63, 1, 66] and other techniques, like early exit\\n[60] or dynamic token reduction [ 64]. We focus on the pruning of the language models, especially\\nstructural pruning [ 26]. Structural pruning removes the entire filter from the neural network, which is\\nmore hardware friendly. There are several ways to remove the structure, such as l1-dependent pruning\\n[16, 67], first-order importance estimation [ 18], hessian-based estimation [21, 52] or the optimal\\nbrain surgeon [24, 21]. As for the pruning unit in structural pruning, some works adopt the entire layer\\n[10] as the minimal unit, and others take the multi-head attention [ 50] or the feed-forward layers\\n[18, 34] as the basic structure to prune. CoFi [59] studies the pruning unit in different granularity.\\nEfficient and Low Resource Compression. With the growing size of models, there is an increasing\\ndemand for efficient LLM compression and compression is independent of the original training data.\\nAs for the efficient compression, [ 22] accelerate the post-training by defining the reconstruction\\nerror as a linear least squares problem. [ 13, 12] propose the layer-wise optimal brain surgeon. As for\\nthe constraint of availability of the training corpus, data-free pruning [ 43, 65] come up with several\\nstrategies to prune the model by measuring neurons’ similarity. Besides, [ 32, 31, 40] proposes\\nmethods that distill the model without reliance on the training corpus of the model. However, those\\nmethods are too time-consuming, involving synthesizing samples by backpropagating the pre-trained\\nlanguage models.\\n3 Methods\\nIn this section, we provide a detailed explanation of LLM-Pruner. Following the conventional model\\ncompression pipeline[22], LLM-Pruner consists of three steps: (1) Discovery Stage (Section 3.1).\\nThis step focuses on identifying groups of interdependent structures within LLMs. (2) Estimation\\nStage (Section 3.2). Once the coupled structures are grouped, the second step entails estimating the\\ncontribution of each group to the overall performance of the model and deciding which group to be\\npruned. (3) Recover Stage (Section 3.3). This step involves fast post-training that alleviates potential\\nperformance degradation caused by the removal of structures.\\n3.1 Discover All Coupled Structure in LLMs\\nIn light of the limited availability of data for post-training, it becomes imperative to prioritize the\\nremoval of structures with minimal damage when compressing the model. This underscores the\\ndependency-based structural pruning, which ensures coupled structures are pruned in unison. We\\nprovide an experiment in Section 4.3 to show the importance of dependency-based structural pruning\\nwhen compressing the large language model.\\nStructure Dependency in LLMs. Similar to [11], the pruning begins by building the dependency\\nfor LLMs. Assume Ni and Nj are two neurons in the model, In(Ni) and Out(Ni) represents all the\\nneurons that point towards or point from Ni. The dependency between structures can be defined as:\\nNj ∈ Out(Ni) ∧ Deg−(Nj) = 1 ⇒ Nj is dependent on Ni (1)\\nwhere Deg−(Nj) represents the in-degree of neuron Nj. Noting that this dependency is directional,\\nwe can therefore correspondingly obtain another dependency:\\nNi ∈ In(Nj) ∧ Deg+(Ni) = 1 ⇒ Ni is dependent on Nj (2)\\nwhere Deg+(Ni) represents the out-degree of neuron Ni. The principle of dependency here is, if a\\ncurrent neuron (e.g., Ni) depends solely on another neuron (e.g., Nj), and the neuron Nj is subjected\\nto pruning, it follows that the neuron Ni must also undergo pruning.\\n3'),\n",

We simplify the neurons in each layer to\\nmake the dependent group clear.

A group can be triggered by a variety of trigger neurons. Taking Group Type B as\\nan example, the trigger for this group involves (i) the attention head, (ii) the output neuron in Query,\\nKey or Value, and (iii) the input neuron in the final output projection.\\nTrigger the Dependency Graph. By having the definition of dependency, the coupled structures\\nin the LLM can be analyzed automatically. Considering any neuron within the LLM as the initial\\ntrigger, it possesses the capability to activate neurons that depend on it. Subsequently, these newly\\ntriggered neurons can serve as the subsequent triggers to identify the dependency and activate their\\nrespective dependent neurons. This iterative process continues until no new neurons are detected.\\nThose neurons then form a group for further pruning. Taking LLaMA as an example, by searching\\nover all the neurons as the initial trigger, we can locate all the coupled structures, as shown in Figure2.\\nGiven the diversity in the structure of different LLMs, manual analysis and removal of coupled\\nstructures in each LLM could be extremely time-consuming. However, by employing LLM-Pruner,\\nall coupled structures can be automatically identified and extracted.\\n3.2 Grouped Importance Estimation of Coupled Structure\\nTill now, all coupled structures within the model are grouped. Weights within the same group should\\nbe pruned simultaneously, as partial pruning not only increases parameter size but also introduces\\nmisaligned intermediate representations. Therefore, we estimate the importance of the group as a\\nwhole, as opposed to evaluating the importance of modules. Given the limited access to the training\\ndataset, we explore the use of public datasets or manually created samples as alternative resources.\\nAlthough the domains of these datasets may not perfectly align with the training set, they still provide\\nvaluable information for assessing the importance.\\nVector-wise Importance. Suppose that given a dataset D = {xi, yi}N\\ni=1, where N is the number of\\nsamples. In our experiments, we set N equal to 10 and we use some public datasets as the source of\\nD. A group (as previously defined as a set of coupled structures) can be defined as G = {Wi}M\\ni=1,\\nwhere M is the number of coupled structures in one group and Wi is the weight for each structure.\\nWhile pruning, our goal is to remove the group that has the least impact on the model’s prediction,\\nwhich can be indicated by the deviation in the loss. Specially, to estimate the importance of Wi, the\\nchange in loss can be formulated as [24]:\\nIWi = |∆L(D)| = |LWi (D) − LWi=0(D)| = | ∂L⊤(D)\\n∂Wi\\nWi\\n| {z }\\n̸=0\\n−1\\n2Wi\\n⊤HWi + O\\n\\x00\\n∥Wi∥3\\x01\\n| (3)\\nwhere H is the hessian matrix. Here, L represents the next-token prediction loss. The first term is\\ntypically neglected in prior work [24, 52, 12], as the model has already converged on the training\\ndataset, where ∂L⊤/∂Wi ≈ 0. However, since D here is not extracted from the original training data,\\nwhich means that ∂L⊤/∂Wi ̸≈ 0. This presents a desirable property for determining the importance\\n4'),\n",

By utilizing either IWk\\ni\\nor IWi , we estimate the importance at the gran-\\nularity of either a parameter or a weight. Remembering that our goal is to estimate the impor-\\ntance of G, we aggregate the importance scores in four ways: (i) Summation: IG = PM\\ni=1 IWi\\nor IG = PM\\ni=1\\nP\\nk IWk\\ni\\n, (ii) Production: IG = QM\\ni=1 IWi or IG = QM\\ni=1\\nP\\nk IWk\\ni\\n, (iii) Max:\\nIG = max M\\ni=1 IWi or IG = max M\\ni=1\\nP\\nk IWk\\ni\\n; (iv) Last-Only: Since deleting the last executing\\nstructure in a dependency group is equivalent to erasing all the computed results within that group,\\nwe assign the importance of the last executing structure as the importance of the group: IG = IWl or\\nIG = P\\nk IWk\\nl\\n, where l is the last structure. After assessing the importance of each group, we rank\\nthe importance of each group and prune the groups with lower importance based on a predefined\\npruning ratio.\\n3.3 Fast Recovery with Low-rank Approximation\\nIn order to expedite the model recovery process and improve its efficiency under limited data, it\\nis crucial to minimize the number of parameters that need optimization during the recovery phase.\\nTo facilitate this, we employ the low-rank approximation, LoRA[ 19], to post-train the pruned\\nmodel. Each learnable weight matrix in the model, denoted as W, encompassing both pruned and\\nunpruned linear projection in the LLM, can be represented as W. The update value ∆W for W\\ncan be decomposed as ∆W = PQ ∈ Rd−×d+\\n, where P ∈ Rd−×d and Q ∈ Rd×d+\\n. The forward\\ncomputation can now be expressed as:\\nf(x) = (W + ∆W)X + b = (WX + b) + (PQ)X (6)\\nwhere b is the bias in the dense layer. Only training P and Q reduces the overall training complexity,\\nreducing the need for large-scale training data. Besides, the extra parameters P and Q can be\\nreparameterized into ∆W, which would not cause extra parameters in the final compressed model.\\n4 Experiments\\n4.1 Experimental Settings\\nFoundation Large Language Model. To showcase the effectiveness and versatility of LLM-Pruner,\\nwe test it over three open-source large language models with two kinds of structure: LLaMA-7B [49],\\nVicuna-7B [4] 2 and ChatGLM-6B [69].\\nEvaluation and Datasets.

Follow [ 14], the model ranks the choices in the multiple choice tasks or\\ngenerates the answer in the open-ended generation 3.

Besides, the results on chatGLM-7B differed significantly\\nfrom these findings.

As shown in Figure 3, the first and last layers\\nhave a profound impact on the model’s performance,\\nand pruning them results in more substantial perfor-\\nmance degradation compared to other layers. How-\\never, due to the uniform treatment of the ‘Channel’\\ngroup across all layers, it becomes inevitable to\\nprune the first and last layers, leading to a signifi-\\ncant decline in performance.\\n7'),\n",

We investigate the impact of pruning the LLM at various\\npruning ratios in Figure 4. We compare our pruning results with the L2 strategy because L2 is also\\na data-free pruning algorithm. It is observed in the experiment of LLaMA that when the pruning\\nratio reaches approximately 20%, the magnitude-dependent algorithm experiences a rapid collapse,\\nleading to the loss of information. Conversely, by employing LLM-Pruner, we are able to increase\\nthe pruning ratio to around 60% while achieving an equivalent perplexity level. Furthermore, in the\\ncase of Vicuna-7B, removing 10% parameters results in a performance decline equivalent to that of\\nLLM-Pruner with 60%. The utilization of LLM-Pruner enables a significant increase in the number\\nof model parameters that can be pruned, thereby substantially reducing computational overhead.\\nTuning on the External Dataset. To tune the pruned model, we utilize the external dataset\\nAlpaca [47]. The evaluation curves of the pruned model on two zero-shot datasets during the post-\\ntraining process are depicted in Figure 5. The results demonstrate a rapid decrease in the perplexity of\\nthe pruned model within 300 steps, followed by a gradual increase. We provide a more comprehensive\\nevaluation in Appendix C.4. It is important to note that if the model is trained for an excessive number\\nof steps, it runs the risk of overfitting the external dataset, potentially compromising its performance\\nin other general-purpose tasks.\\nImpact of Dependency-based Structured Pruning. To study the importance of dependency-based\\nstructural pruning, we conduct an experiment to disrupt dependencies within groups, where each\\nweight matrix Wi is pruned solely based on the importance score estimated on itself. Table 6\\npresents the results demonstrating the impact of dependencies in structural pruning. In the absence\\nof dependencies, the model nearly fails in the zero-shot generation and classification tasks. Even\\nwith tuning, the model fails to recover, showing a substantial difference compared to the results in\\ndependency-based pruning.\\nImpact of Different Aggregation Strategies. We conduct tests on the aggregation algorithms\\nproposed in Section 3.2. Our experimental results unveil notable discrepancies in model performance\\nacross different aggregation strategies, with particular emphasis on the ‘Last-only’ strategy. Among\\nthe evaluated approaches, the ‘Max’ strategy attains the most favorable outcomes in terms of perplex-\\nity, signifying enhanced coherence and fluency in sentence generation. However, it is important to\\nnote that the ‘Max’ strategy exhibits the poorest zero-shot classification results compared to all four\\nstrategies. Conversely, the ‘Last-only’ strategy showcases superior classification performance but\\n8'),\n",

LLM-Pruner outperforms DistilBERT by 4.24% on average\\nwith even a smaller size. The reason lies in that LLM-Pruner\\nminimizes model disruption during pruning, whereas Distil-\\nBERT merely selects one layer out of two. As a result, the\\nmodel pruned by LLM-Pruner demands less data to recover its\\nperformance compared with DistilBERT, consequently achiev-\\ning superior performance.\\nScratch Training vs. Pruning. We compare LLM-Pruner with StableLM-3B 4 with a similar\\nparameter size. To ensure fairness, both models are fine-tuned on the Alpaca dataset. The experimental\\nresults of these two models are shown in the Table 9. LLM-Pruner crafts lightweight LLMs with\\nlow resources, and even can sometimes achieve better performance than LLMs from scratch training.\\nHowever, we also acknowledge that the LLaMA-3B obtained by LLM-Pruner will not always\\noutperform other 3B models from scratch training, due to the huge gap in the size of training corpus.\\nTable 9: Scratch Training (StableLM-3B) vs. LLaMA-3B (by LLM-Pruner)\\nPruning Ratio#Param LatencyBoolQ PIQA HellaSwag WinoGrande ARC-e ARC-c OBQAAverage\\nStableLM-3B3.6B 31.69s 48.78 69.48 44.52 54.62 50.93 25.17 27.40 45.84\\nLLaMA-3B 3.6B 37.96s 61.41 70.08 51.01 55.01 46.80 30.38 37.40 50.30\\nCase Study. We provide some examples of sentences generated by the model compressed using\\nLLM-Pruner in Table 10. We made efforts to ensure a minimal overlap between these generated\\nsentences and the information contained in the tuning corpus, which demonstrates that the information\\noriginates from the original model rather than the tuning corpus. We provide additional examples\\nin the Appendix, including the generated sentences of the model without post-training. From the\\ncases in Table 10, it is evident that the sentences generated by the compressed model are comparable\\nto those produced by the original model. They exhibit fluency, relevance, and informativeness\\nregarding the given topic. Nevertheless, during our experiments, we observed that the pruned model’s\\nperformance deviates from that of the original model, particularly when generating lengthy sentences.\\nOccasionally, it may generate sentences that are meaningless or contain repetitive tokens.\\n5 Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we propose LLM-Pruner, a structured pruning approach for large language models.\\nLLM-Pruner aims to compress sizable language models in a task-agnostic manner while minimizing\\nthe dependency on the original training corpus and preserving the linguistic capabilities of LLMs.\\nLLM-Pruner accomplishes this by iteratively examining each neuron within the model as a trigger\\nfor identifying dependency groups, thereby constructing the LLM’s dependency graph. Subsequently,\\nLLM-Pruner assesses the importance of these groups using both parameter-wise and weight-wise\\nestimation. Finally, we utilize LoRA for fast recovery and adjustment of the pruned model. We evalu-\\nate the efficacy of LLM-Pruner on three distinct models—LLaMA, Vicuna, and ChatGLM—utilizing\\n4https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-3b\\n9'),\n",

All the cases are extracted from the multi-head\\nattention module.\\nWe provide a detailed explanation of the two dependency rules. It is important to note that these\\ndependency rules do not pertain solely to the forward computation. Instead, they represent directional\\nrelationships that exist in both directions. For instance, removing a node in a subsequent layer may\\nalso result in the pruning of a node in the preceding layer. Recall the two dependency rules as follows:\\nNj ∈ Out(Ni) ∧ Deg−(Nj) = 1 ⇒ Nj is dependent on Ni (7)\\nNi ∈ In(Nj) ∧ Deg+(Ni) = 1 ⇒ Ni is dependent on Nj (8)\\nwhere Ni and Nj are two neurons. In(Ni) and Out(Ni) represents all the neurons that point towards\\nor point from Ni. Deg−(Ni) and Deg+(Ni) represents the in-degree and out-degree of neuron Ni.\\nFigure 6 serves as an illustration of the two dependency rules:\\n• In case 1, Node I and Node J satisfy the rule stated in Eq.7. Consequently, Node J depends on\\nNode I. When Node I is pruned, it is necessary to prune Node J as well.\\n• In case 2, Node I and Node J satisfy the rule Eq.8. Thus, Node I is dependent on Node J. If Node J\\nis pruned, it becomes imperative to prune Node I as well.\\n• In case 3, Node J and Node K do not meet the requirement of Eq.7 due to the mismatch in\\nDeg−(Nk) ̸= 1. Thus, with Node J pruned, Node K would not be affected.\\nB Implementation Details\\nB.1 For Pruning\\nFor the baseline Given the lack of previous work on the structural pruning of Large Language\\nModels in a task-agnostic and low-resource setting, there is currently no existing baseline for our\\nmodel. To provide a comprehensive demonstration of the effectiveness of LLM-Pruner, we employ\\ntwo additional methods for evaluation, alongside the data-free pruning method. All of these methods\\nare built upon the dependent groups identified in Section 3.1:\\n• L2: We assess the importance of each group based on the magnitude of its weight matrix.\\n• Random: This method involves randomly selecting certain groups for pruning.\\nFor the ‘Block’ Group. Based on the findings presented in Table 3, it is preferable to leave the\\nfirst three layers and the final layer unchanged, as modifying parameters in those layers significantly\\nimpacts the model. Within each module, such as the MLP or the Multi-head Attention, the discovered\\ngroups are pruned based on a pre-set ratio. For instance, in the MLP layer of LLaMA-7B, we\\nidentified 11,008 groups, and with a 25% pruning ratio, the module would prune 2,752 groups. It\\nis worth noting that the pruning rate for the selected groups is higher than the pruning ratio for the\\nparameters, as certain layers (e.g., the embedding layer and excluded layers mentioned) retain their\\nparameters. When aiming for a parameter pruning ratio of 20%, we prune 25% from Layer 5 to Layer\\n30. Similarly, for a 50% parameter removal, we prune 60% of the groups from Layer 4 to Layer 30.\\n15'),\n",

The Group ’Channel’ exhibits a resemblance to dimension pruning\\nin the model, targeting the pruning of certain dimensions. In the case of the Query, Key, and Value\\nprojection in MHA, only the input dimension is pruned, while for the Output projection in MHA,\\nonly the output dimension is pruned. It is important to note that the entire dependency is established\\nautomatically, without any manual design involved. The ‘Channel’ group operates in a complementary\\nmanner to the ‘Block Group’. In the ‘Channel’ Group, the pruning ratio of the group equals to the\\npruning ratio of the parameters, as all weight matrices, including the embedding matrix, undergo\\npruning. Therefore, a 20% pruning ratio of parameters implies pruning 20% of the groups, while a\\n50% pruning ratio implies pruning 50% of the groups.\\nB.2 For Recovery Stage\\nTable 11: Ablation: Tuning\\ndifferent modules in the re-\\ncovery stage\\nModule WikiText↓ PTB↓\\nALL 17.36 29.99\\n- MLP 17.64 30.63\\n- MHA 17.62 30.23\\nWe follow [19] in our recovery stage.

Consequently, we conduct an experiment aimed at model recovery with\\nmore data, employing a dataset comprising 2.59 million samples [ 57]. The results are detailed in\\nTable 12.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks\\n(RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and\\ncomputational requirements but struggle to\\nmatch the same performance as Transformers\\ndue to limitations in parallelization and scala-\\nbility.

This\\nhas stimulated research to enhance Transformers’\\nscalability, sometimes sacrificing some of their ef-\\nfectiveness (Wang et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020;\\nDao et al., 2022a).\\nTo tackle these challenges, we introduce the Re-\\nceptance Weighted Key Value ( RWKV) model,\\ncombining the strengths of RNNs and Transform-\\ners while circumventing key drawbacks.

This implementation,\\nwithout approximation, offers the lowest computa-\\ntional and memory complexity; see Table 1.\\nThe motivation behind RWKV is to balance com-\\nputational efficiency with expressive capacity in\\nneural networks.

However,\\nunlike AFT where W is a pairwise matrix, our\\nmodel treats W as a channel-wise vector that is\\nmodified by relative position.

(17)\\nIn the channel-mixing block, a similar operation\\nis performed:\\no′\\nt = σ(r′\\nt) ⊙ (W′\\nv · max(k′\\nt, 0)2), (18)\\nwhere we adopt the squared ReLU activation func-\\ntion (So et al., 2021).\\n3.2 Transformer-like Training\\nRWKV can be efficiently parallelized using a tech-\\nnique called time-parallel mode, reminiscent of\\nTransformers. The time complexity of processing\\na batch of sequences in a single layer is O(BT d2),\\nprimarily consisting of matrix multiplications Wλ,\\nwhere λ ∈ {r, k, v, o} (assuming B sequences, T\\nmaximum tokens, and d channels). In contrast, up-\\ndating attention scores wkvt involves a serial scan\\n(see Appendix D for more detail) and has complex-\\nity O(BT d).\\nThe matrix multiplications can be parallelized\\nsimilarly to Wλ, where λ ∈ {Q, K, V, O} in con-\\nventional Transformers. The element-wise W KV\\ncomputation is time-dependent but can be readily\\nparallelized along the other two dimensions (Lei\\net al., 2018)3.\\n3.3 RNN-like Inference\\nRecurrent networks commonly utilize the output\\nat state t as input at state t + 1. This usage is\\nalso observed in the autoregressive decoding infer-\\nence of language models, where each token must\\nbe computed before being passed to the next step.\\nRWKV takes advantage of this RNN-like structure,\\nknown as time-sequential mode. In this context,\\nRWKV can be conveniently formulated recursively\\nfor decoding during inference, as demonstrated in\\nAppendix D.\\n3.4 Additional Optimizations\\nCustom Kernels To address inefficiencies in the\\nW KVcomputation arising from the sequential na-\\nture of the task when using standard deep learning\\nframeworks, we have developed a custom CUDA\\n3For extremely long sequences, more sophisticated meth-\\nods such as Martin and Cundy (2017) that parallelize over\\nsequence length could be used.'),\n",

The majority of weights are\\ninitialized to zero, and linear layers do not employ\\nbiases. Detailed formulas are given in Appendix E.\\nWe observe that the choice of initialization plays a\\ncrucial role in both the speed and quality of conver-\\ngence (refer to Appendix F for further details).\\n3.5 Implementation\\nRWKV is implemented using the PyTorch Deep\\nLearning Library (Paszke et al., 2019). We inte-\\ngrate additional optimization strategies inspired by\\nDeepSpeed (Rasley et al., 2020) into the system,\\nimproving its efficiency and scalability.\\nThe model begins with an embedding layer, as\\ndetailed in Section 3.4. Following this are sev-\\neral identical residual blocks arranged sequentially.\\nThese are depicted in Figures 2 and 3 and adheres\\nto the principles outlined in Section 3.1.1. After\\nthe last block, a simple output projection head, con-\\nsisting of a LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) and a\\nlinear projection, is employed for logits generation\\nfor next-token prediction and computation of the\\ncross-entropy loss during training.\\n4 Trained Models and Computing Costs\\nTo demonstrate the scalability of RWKV , we train\\nsix models ranging from 169 million to 14 billion\\nparameters as shown in Table 2.

These factors can include the model\\nsize (N), dataset size ( D), or the optimally allo-\\ncated compute budget ( Cmin). Scaling laws are\\nimportant for two primary reasons: they allow us\\nto make predictions and plans regarding the costs\\nand performance of large models before they are\\ntrained via interpolation and extrapolation (Black\\net al., 2022; Le Scao et al., 2022) and the contexts\\nin which they fail provides rich feedback on im-\\nportant areas for future research (Wei et al., 2022a;\\nBiderman et al., 2023a).\\nPrevious work on scaling laws for RNNs has\\nclaimed that LSTMs do not strictly follow the same\\nlog-log linear scaling that transformers do (Kaplan\\net al., 2020).

All RWKV models were trained for one\\nepoch on the Pile (330B tokens), which is close but\\nnot identical to the amount of tokens the Pythia,\\nOPT, and BLOOM models were trained for. Con-\\nsequently, we compare our models on a FLOP-\\nmatched basis. We avoid comparing with model\\ntrained in the Chinchilla-optimal regime (Hoff-\\nmann et al., 2022) or the overtrained regime (Tou-\\nvron et al., 2023) to ensure the most equitable com-\\nparison.\\nWe report results on ARC (both Easy and Chal-\\nlenge) (Clark et al., 2018), BoolQ (Clark et al.,\\n2019), COPA (Roemmele et al., 2018), HeadQA\\n(Vilares and Gómez-Rodríguez, 2019), HellaSwag\\n(Zellers et al., 2019), LAMBADA (Paperno et al.,\\n2016), OpenBookQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018),\\nPIQA (Bisk et al., 2020), ReCoRD (Zhang et al.,\\n2018), SciQ (Johannes Welbl Nelson F.

While many alternatives\\nto Transformers have been proposed with similar\\nclaims, ours is the first to back up those claims with\\npretrained models with tens of billions of parame-\\nters.\\n9 Limitations\\nWhile our proposed RWKV model has demon-\\nstrated promising results regarding training and\\nmemory efficiency during inference, some limita-\\ntions should be acknowledged and addressed in\\nfuture work.\\nFirst, the linear attention of RWKV leads to sig-\\nnificant efficiency gains but still, it may also limit\\nthe model’s performance on tasks that require re-\\ncalling minutiae information over very long con-\\ntexts. This is due to the funneling of informa-\\ntion through a single vector representation over\\nmany time steps, compared with the full informa-\\ntion maintained by the quadratic attention of stan-\\ndard Transformers. In other words, the model’s\\nrecurrent architecture inherently limits its ability to\\n“look back” at previous tokens, as opposed to tra-\\nditional self-attention mechanisms. While learned\\ntime decay helps prevent the loss of information,\\nit is mechanistically limited compared to full self-\\nattention.\\nAnother limitation of this work is the increased\\nimportance of prompt engineering in comparison to\\nstandard Transformer models. The linear attention\\nmechanism used in RWKV limits the information\\nfrom the prompt that will be carried over to the\\nmodel’s continuation. As a result, carefully de-\\nsigned prompts may be even more crucial for the\\nmodel to perform well on tasks.\\nThe above RWKV property was confirmed by\\nstudies on prompt engineering presented in Ap-\\npendix L. By changing the order of the information'),\n",

Since the\\ntraining code is released open source, RWKV con-\\ntributes to the democratization of AI, levels the\\nplaying field, and empowers members of the Open\\nSource community to inspect, study, and finetune\\nRWKV in particular tasks. Moreover, it contributes\\nto advancing the understanding of LLMs capabili-\\nties and limitations. A significant amount of work\\nhas been devoted to increasing the efficiency of\\nRWKV training so as to minimize its cost and pro-\\nmote accessibility.\\nAs LLMs trained on public data, RWKV’s lower\\ninference cost compared to Transformer alterna-\\ntives makes it more suitable for deployment in con-\\nsumer and edge hardware, which is a step towards\\nthe democratization and distribution of LLMs to\\nthe general public, creating better privacy and own-\\nership incentives. It also lowers the resource bar-\\nrier to Chat assistants and text generation for small\\nand/or underrepresented communities. PreTrained\\nmodel weights for different sizes ranging from 0.1B\\nto 14B parameters trained on multiple languages\\nare released to increase ease of adoption and allow\\nfor the study of emergent phenomena.\\nOn the other hand, with lower resource barri-\\ners, the spreading of AI-generated text might be-\\ncome more prevalent. Current RWKV LLMs may\\nexhibit and/or reproduce biases and potentially\\nharmful content present in the data used for train-\\ning. Nonetheless, mitigation and finetuning strate-\\ngies discussed for other, large Transformer models\\nshould be applicable to RWKV as well.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe thank StabilityAI for the compute used to train\\nour models and for technical support in develop-\\nment of RWKV .

Experiments for table 5.\\nC Additional Related Work\\nRecently, a number of techniques have been proposed to address the limitations of transformers.\\nOptimizing Attention Mechanism Many transformer variants (“x-formers”) have been introduced to\\nreduce the complexity of transformers (Tay et al., 2022), including sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020;\\nKitaev et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2022), approximating the full attention matrix (Wang et al., 2020; Ma et al.,\\n2021; Choromanski et al., 2020), combining chunked attention with gating (Ma et al., 2023) and other\\nefficient methods (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Jaegle et al., 2021).\\nSome recent works like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a) and others (Rabe and Staats, 2022; Jang et al.,\\n2019) share similarities with RWKV’s chunked computation scheme. Despite being memory-efficient,\\ntheir time complexity remains quadratic or contains chunk size as a hidden factor. In contrast, RWKV\\nachieves better space and time complexity during inference by formulating a linear attention as an RNN.\\nAttention Free Models Another line of research replaces the attention mechanism with other modules to\\nscale to long sequences. MLP-Mixer and others (Tolstikhin et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021) propose replacing\\nattention by Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in computer vision tasks. The Attention Free Transformer\\n(AFT) (Zhai et al., 2021) and HrrFormer (Alam et al., 2023) replaces dot-product self-attention with a\\ncomputationally efficient alternative. None of these models have been successfully scaled to the point\\nwhere drawing comparisons with transformer-based large language models makes sense.\\nThere has also been substantial research into state space models (SSM) (Gu et al., 2021) and its variants\\n(Dao et al., 2022b; Gupta et al., 2022; Poli et al., 2023). In contrast to the preceding models, SSM and\\nits successors have shown substantial progress towards efficient scaling. Simultaneously with this work,\\nPoli et al. (2023) train SSM-based models with 125 million and 355 million parameters and show that the\\nperformance is on-par with a transformer that uses a mix of local and global attention (Black et al., 2021).\\nAdvances in RNNs Inspired by the success of transformers, RNN-style (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber,\\n1997; Chung et al., 2014) recursive components have also been modified to increase context length, such\\nas the Recurrent Memory Transformer (Bulatov et al., 2022, 2023) and Linear Recurrent Units (Orvieto\\net al., 2023). Most similar to our work, the Quasi-Recurrent neural network (QRNN) (Bradbury et al.,\\n2017) uses both convolutional layers and recurrent pooling functions across timesteps and channels.\\nWhile QRNN utilizes convolutional filters with fixed sizes, RWKV employs a time-mixing module as\\nan attention mechanism with time-decaying factors. Different from the element-wise pooling in QRNN,\\nRWKV includes a parametrized channel-mixing module that is parallelizable.'),\n",

To avoid\\noverflow in calculating ekt, a numerical trick is\\nused in the official implementation. Noticing\\nthat a1 = ek1 ⊙ v1 and b1 = ek1 , we set a′\\n1 =\\nv1, b′\\n1 = 1, p1 = k1, where pt stores the shared\\nexponents of at and bt.

(28)\\nThe RWKV model has an internal state that stores some previous information. In each layer, the internal\\nstate consists five parts, each of which is a vector with D numbers, where D is the model dimension. The\\nfive parts are:\\n• The current input of the Time-mix block xt;\\n• The current input of the Channel-mix block yt;\\n• The numerator of the W KVvalue a′\\nt, as defined in equation (26);\\n• The denominator of the W KVvalue b′\\nt, as defined in equation (27);\\n• An auxiliary state pt in (28), which is used for W KVcomputation to maintain numerical precision.\\nWhich yields a total size of 5DL parameters. It is worth noting that in an algebraic context with infinite\\nprecision, the helper state pt can be ignored, and the W KVnumerator and denominator can be computed\\ndirectly using equations (21) and (22), reducing the size of the internal state to 4DL.\\nE Parameter initializations\\nWe describe the specific parameter initializations below and motivate the design choices. Parameters\\nbelonging to residual blocks are often adjusted by layer depth and total number of layers.

On the other hand, in the small initialization of the embedding (small\\ninit emb) experiment, the parameters are initialized using a uniform distribution with a range of 1e-4,\\nwhich is slightly different from RWKV where a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 1e-4\\nis used. However, this difference is negligible and does not affect our conclusions. The experiments\\nwere conducted with a batch size of 400. As depicted in Figure 9, the loss curve for the small init emb\\nexhibits a faster rate of decrease and convergence compared to the traditional initialization using a normal\\ndistribution.\\n0 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000\\nStep\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11Loss\\nBaseline\\nSmall Init Emb\\nFigure 9: Effect of small initialization embedding.\\nG Hyperparameters\\nTo train the models mentioned, we use ϵ = (0.9, 0.99) without weight decay for the Adam optimizer, and\\nswitch batch size dynamically between 128 or 256 sequences, each of 1024 tokens.

By gradient stability we mean that if the inputs xt are bounded and\\nthe model parameters are fixed, then the gradients with respect to Wk and Wv are uniformly bounded for\\nall T (thus not exploding). Consequently, we can control the amount each xt contributes to the gradient at\\nT in a naturally decaying fashion by the weight decay mechanism w (thus not vanishing unless desired).\\nFirst, we make the simplification that there are no token shifts, this will not affect the final conclusion.\\nIn this scenario, wkvT can be written as\\nwkvT =\\nPT\\nt=1 Ke\\nt ⊙ vt\\nPT\\nt=1 Ke\\nt\\n= E(vt) =S(vt)\\nS(1) , (29)\\nwhere\\nvt = Wvxt, ∂(vt)i\\n∂(Wv)i,j\\n= (xt)j,\\nKe\\nt = eWkxt+wT,t , ∂(Ke\\nt )i\\n∂(Wk)i,j\\n= (xt)j(Ke\\nt )i,\\nand S(·) and E(·) are shorthand for denoting sums and averages over weights Ke\\nt .\\nThe loss function at position T can be written as\\nLT = l(f(wkvT ), yT ).

Corrupt the input embeddings of the subject using noise (“The Eiffel Tower” in this example);\\n3. Restore the states and activation of a certain layer at a certain token during the computation, and\\nrecord the log-probability of the model outputting the correct answer (“Paris”).\\nUnlike transformers, RWKV relies on the recursive propagation of information in the time dimension.\\nIn this case, the fact that the Eiffel Tower is located in Paris is retrieved in layer 4 just after the model\\nsees “The Eiffel”. It is then passed down to the subsequent layers. In layer 20, mostly, the information is\\npropagated through time until reaching where it is needed. Finally, at the token “of”, it is passed down to\\nthe last layer for outputting the answer.\\nJ Additional Evaluations\\nJ.1 Further details on NLP tasks\\nWe evaluate on the following tasks:\\nARC (Clark et al., 2018) A dataset designed for multiple-choice question answering, encompassing\\nscience exam questions ranging from third grade to ninth grade.

SOTA is provided as a supplementary reference.\\nL Importance of prompt construction and comparison to GPT models\\nInspired by Koco´n et al. (2023), we compared the zero-shot performance of the RWKV-4-Raven-14B with\\nChatGPT (access in February 2023) and GPT-4 using several known NLP tasks, i.e., recognizing textual\\nentailment (RTE), Winograd Natural Language Inference (WNLI), and recognizing emotions elicited\\nin readers (GoEmotions and PolEmo2). Each model got the same prompts manually chosen to receive\\nproper responses from the ChatGPT model. As shown in Tab. 6, RWKV performs significantly worse\\nthan ChatGPT and GPT-4 in several specific tasks. We suspect that this disparity is likely caused by the\\nchoice of prompts used to generate the answers since the prompts are written in natural language and do\\nnot take into account that RWKV , as an RNN, is unable to look back inside an instruction.\\nWhen the instruction style was adapted (re-ordered) to respect that RNNs are not capable of \"retro-\\nspective processing\", the quality may significantly change, e.g., for RTE (Wang et al., 2019) F1 Macro\\nincreased from 44.2% to 74.8%. We hypothesize that RWKV models are more sensitive to the position of\\nthe components in the context, as RNN-based architectures cannot look back and readjust the weight of\\nprevious information. For better performance, the desired information should be placed after the main\\nquestion.\\nAn example ChatGPT prompt for recognizing textual entailment (RTE)\\nHaving premise <here is a premise> judge if the following hypothesis <here is a hypothesis> is\\nlogically connected with the premise. Answer \"entailment\" if yes, or \"not_entailment\" if no.\\nA re-ordered RWKV prompt for RTE taking into account the nature of the RNN\\nCan you tell me if the hypothesis is entailment or is not entailment to the premise?\\npremise: <here is a premise>\\nhypothesis: <here is a hypothesis>\\nWhile separating the instruction from the input is relatively easy to do, some other aspects of prompt\\nengineering are harder to quantify. For that purpose, we also tested the approach of stating the input after'),\n",

The results suggest that better\\nprompts might reduce the disparity between models. Raven achieves comparable results to ChatGPT on\\nunhealthy conversation detection and even surpasses it on the sarcasm detection dataset. While such an\\napproach to prompting looks necessary, it is not enough in itself to replace the capability of having free\\naccess to the whole context. Therefore, prompt engineering seems to be significantly more important for\\nthe RNN models rather than for standard transformers. It is entirely possible that good prompts to RNN\\nmodels do not mean additional restrictions, but should simply be constructed using completely different\\nguidelines. The authors of the aforementioned paper (Koco ´n et al., 2023) 4 perform chain-of-thought\\nto improve results on the MathQA dataset. Even including this approach, the Raven model achieved a\\nvery low accuracy of 5.43%. Without it, the model performed even worse, performing only very basic\\nand simple calculations and achieving 4.13% accuracy. Raven struggled with questions that required\\nintermediate results. It is likely that the order of information presented in the math questions inside the\\ndataset poses a challenge for the RWKV model.

While recent quantization\\nmethods can reduce the memory footprint of LLMs [14, 13, 18, 66], such techniques only work for\\ninference and break down during training [65].\\nWe demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to finetune a quantized 4-bit model without any\\nperformance degradation.

Therefore, we train more than 1,000 models across several instruction tuning datasets,\\nmodel architectures, and sizes between 80M to 65B parameters. In addition to showing that QLORA\\nrecovers 16-bit performance (§4) and training a state-of-the-art chatbot, Guanaco, (§5), we also\\nanalyze trends in the trained models. First, we find that data quality is far more important than\\ndataset size, e.g., a 9k sample dataset (OASST1) outperformed a 450k sample dataset (FLAN v2,\\nsubsampled) on chatbot performance, even when both are meant to support instruction following\\ngeneralization.

We use tournament-style benchmarking where models compete\\nagainst each other in matches to produce the best response for a given prompt. The winner of a\\nmatch is judged by either GPT-4 or human annotators. The tournament results are aggregated into\\nElo scores [16, 17] which determine the ranking of chatbot performance. We find that GPT-4 and\\nhuman evaluations largely agree on the rank of model performance in the tournaments, but we also\\nfind there are instances of strong disagreement. As such, we highlight that model-based evaluation\\nwhile providing a cheap alternative to human-annotation also has its uncertainties.\\nWe augment our chatbot benchmark results with a qualitative analysis ofGuanaco models.

QLORA improves over LoRA by\\nquantizing the transformer model to 4-bit precision and using paged optimizers to handle memory spikes.\\n2 Background\\nBlock-wise k-bit Quantization Quantization is the process of discretizing an input from a rep-\\nresentation that holds more information to a representation with less information. It often means\\ntaking a data type with more bits and converting it to fewer bits, for example from 32-bit floats to\\n8-bit Integers. To ensure that the entire range of the low-bit data type is used, the input data type is\\ncommonly rescaled into the target data type range through normalization by the absolute maximum\\nof the input elements, which are usually structured as a tensor. For example, quantizing a 32-bit\\nFloating Point (FP32) tensor into a Int8 tensor with range [−127, 127]:\\nXInt8 = round\\n\\x12 127\\nabsmax(XFP32)XFP32\\n\\x13\\n= round(cFP32 · XFP32), (1)\\nwhere c is the quantization constant or quantization scale. Dequantization is the inverse:\\ndequant(cFP32, XInt8) =XInt8\\ncFP32 = XFP32 (2)\\nThe problem with this approach is that if a large magnitude value (i.e., an outlier) occurs in the input\\ntensor, then the quantization bins—certain bit combinations—are not utilized well with few or no\\nnumbers quantized in some bins. To prevent the outlier issue, a common approach is to chunk the\\ninput tensor into blocks that are independently quantized, each with their own quantization constant c.\\nThis can be formalized as follows: We chunk the input tensor X ∈ Rb×h into n contiguous blocks of\\nsize B by flattening the input tensor and slicing the linear segment into n = (b × h)/B blocks. We\\nquantize these blocks independently with Equation 1 to create a quantized tensor and n quantization\\nconstants ci.\\nLow-rank Adapters Low-rank Adapter (LoRA) finetuning [28] is a method that reduces memory\\nrequirements by using a small set of trainable parameters, often termed adapters, while not updating\\nthe full model parameters which remain fixed. Gradients during stochastic gradient descent are\\npassed through the fixed pretrained model weights to the adapter, which is updated to optimize the\\nloss function. LoRA augments a linear projection through an additional factorized projection. Given\\na projection XW = Y with X ∈ Rb×h, W ∈ Rh×o LoRA computes:\\nY = XW + sXL1L2, (3)\\nwhere L1 ∈ Rh×r and L2 ∈ Rr×o, and s is a scalar.\\nMemory Requirement of Parameter-Efficient Finetuning One important point of discussion is\\nthe memory requirement of LoRA during training both in terms of the number and size of adapters\\nused. Since the memory footprint of LoRA is so minimal, we can use more adapters to improve\\nperformance without significantly increasing the total memory used. While LoRA was designed as a\\n3'),\n",

For a 7B LLaMA\\nmodel trained on FLAN v2 with a batch size of 1, with LoRA weights equivalent to commonly used\\n0.2% of the original model weights[ 28, 37], the LoRA input gradients have a memory footprint\\nof 567 MB while the LoRA parameters take up only 26 MB. With gradient checkpointing [9], the\\ninput gradients reduce to an average of 18 MB per sequence making them more memory intensive\\nthan all LoRA weights combined. In comparison, the 4-bit base model consumes 5,048 MB of\\nmemory. This highlights that gradient checkpointing is important but also that aggressively reducing\\nthe amount of LoRA parameter yields only minor memory benefits. This means we can use more\\nadapters without significantly increasing the overall training memory footprint (see Appendix G\\nfor a detailed breakdown). As discussed later, this is crucial for recovering full 16-bit precision\\nperformance.\\n3 QL ORA Finetuning\\nQLORA achieves high-fidelity 4-bit finetuning via two techniques we propose—4-bit NormalFloat\\n(NF4) quantization and Double Quantization. Additionally, we introduce Paged Optimizers, to\\nprevent memory spikes during gradient checkpointing from causing out-of-memory errors that have\\ntraditionally made finetuning on a single machine difficult for large models.\\nQLORA has one low-precision storage data type, in our case usually 4-bit, and one computation data\\ntype that is usually BFloat16. In practice, this means whenever a QLORA weight tensor is used, we\\ndequantize the tensor to BFloat16, and then perform a matrix multiplication in 16-bit.\\nWe now discuss the components of QLORA followed by a formal definition of QL ORA.\\n4-bit NormalFloat Quantization The NormalFloat (NF) data type builds on Quantile Quantization\\n[15] which is an information-theoretically optimal data type that ensures each quantization bin has an\\nequal number of values assigned from the input tensor. Quantile quantization works by estimating\\nthe quantile of the input tensor through the empirical cumulative distribution function.\\nThe main limitation of quantile quantization is that the process of quantile estimation is expensive.\\nTherefore fast quantile approximation algorithms, such as SRAM quantiles [15], are used to estimate\\nthem. Due to the approximate nature of these quantile estimation algorithms, the data type has large\\nquantization errors for outliers, which are often the most important values.\\nExpensive quantile estimates and approximation errors can be avoided when input tensors come from\\na distribution fixed up to a quantization constant. In such cases, input tensors have the same quantiles\\nmaking exact quantile estimation computationally feasible.\\nSince pretrained neural network weights usually have a zero-centered normal distribution with\\nstandard deviation σ (see Appendix F), we can transform all weights to a single fixed distribution by\\nscaling σ such that the distribution fits exactly into the range of our data type. For our data type, we\\nset the arbitrary range [−1, 1]. As such, both the quantiles for the data type and the neural network\\nweights need to be normalized into this range.\\nThe information theoretically optimal data type for zero-mean normal distributions with arbitrary\\nstandard deviations σ in the range [−1, 1] is computed as follows: (1) estimate the 2k + 1quantiles\\nof a theoretical N(0, 1) distribution to obtain a k-bit quantile quantization data type for normal distri-\\nbutions, (2) take this data type and normalize its values into the [−1, 1] range, (3) quantize an input\\nweight tensor by normalizing it into the [−1, 1] range through absolute maximum rescaling.\\nOnce the weight range and data type range match, we can quantize as usual. Step (3) is equivalent to\\nrescaling the standard deviation of the weight tensor to match the standard deviation of the k-bit data\\ntype. More formally, we estimate the 2k values qi of the data type as follows:\\nqi = 1\\n2\\n\\x12\\nQX\\n\\x12 i\\n2k + 1\\n\\x13\\n+ QX\\n\\x12 i + 1\\n2k + 1\\n\\x13\\x13\\n, (4)\\nwhere QX(·) is the quantile function of the standard normal distribution N(0, 1). A problem for\\na symmetric k-bit quantization is that this approach does not have an exact representation of zero,\\nwhich is an important property to quantize padding and other zero-valued elements with no error.

The exact values of this data type can be found in Appendix E.\\nDouble Quantization We introduce Double Quantization (DQ), the process of quantizing the\\nquantization constants for additional memory savings. While a small blocksize is required for precise\\n4-bit quantization [ 13], it also has a considerable memory overhead. For example, using 32-bit\\nconstants and a blocksize of 64 for W, quantization constants add 32/64 = 0.5 bits per parameter on\\naverage. Double Quantization helps reduce the memory footprint of quantization constants.\\nMore specifically, Double Quantization treats quantization constants cFP32\\n2 of the first quantization\\nas inputs to a second quantization. This second step yields the quantized quantization constants\\ncFP8\\n2 and the second level of quantization constants cFP32\\n1 . We use 8-bit Floats with a blocksize of\\n256 for the second quantization as no performance degradation is observed for 8-bit quantization,\\nin line with results from Dettmers and Zettlemoyer [13]. Since the cFP32\\n2 are positive, we subtract\\nthe mean from c2 before quantization to center the values around zero and make use of symmetric\\nquantization. On average, for a blocksize of 64, this quantization reduces the memory footprint per\\nparameter from 32/64 = 0.5 bits, to 8/64 + 32/(64 · 256) = 0.127 bits, a reduction of 0.373 bits\\nper parameter.\\nPaged Optimizers use the NVIDIA unified memory 3 feature wich does automatic page-to-page\\ntransfers between the CPU and GPU for error-free GPU processing in the scenario where the GPU\\noccasionally runs out-of-memory. The feature works like regular memory paging between CPU RAM\\nand the disk. We use this feature to allocate paged memory for the optimizer states which are then\\nautomatically evicted to CPU RAM when the GPU runs out-of-memory and paged back into GPU\\nmemory when the memory is needed in the optimizer update step.\\nQLORA. Using the components described above, we define QLORA for a single linear layer in\\nthe quantized base model with a single LoRA adapter as follows:\\nYBF16 = XBF16doubleDequant(cFP32\\n1 , ck-bit\\n2 , WNF4) +XBF16LBF16\\n1 LBF16\\n2 , (5)\\nwhere doubleDequant(·) is defined as:\\ndoubleDequant(cFP32\\n1 , ck-bit\\n2 , Wk-bit) =dequant(dequant(cFP32\\n1 , ck-bit\\n2 ), W4bit) =WBF16, (6)\\nWe use NF4 for W and FP8 for c2. We use a blocksize of 64 for W for higher quantization precision\\nand a blocksize of 256 for c2 to conserve memory.\\nFor parameter updates only the gradient with respect to the error for the adapters weights ∂E\\n∂Li\\nare\\nneeded, and not for 4-bit weights ∂E\\n∂W. However, the calculation of ∂E\\n∂Li\\nentails the calculation of ∂X\\n∂W\\nwhich proceeds via equation (5) with dequantization from storage WNF4 to computation data type\\nWBF16 to calculate the derivative ∂X\\n∂W in BFloat16 precision.\\nTo summarize, QLORA has one storage data type (usually 4-bit NormalFloat) and a computation\\ndata type (16-bit BrainFloat). We dequantize the storage data type to the computation data type\\nto perform the forward and backward pass, but we only compute weight gradients for the LoRA\\nparameters which use 16-bit BrainFloat.\\n4 QLoRA vs. Standard Finetuning\\nWe have discussed how QLoRA works and how it can significantly reduce the required memory for\\nfinetuning models. The main question now is whether QLoRA can perform as well as full-model\\nfinetuning.

Results are\\nshown in Table 3. In both datasets, we observe that 16-bit, 8-bit,\\nand 4-bit adapter methods replicate the performance of the fully\\nfinetuned 16-bit baseline. This suggests that the performance lost\\ndue to the imprecise quantization can be fully recovered through\\nadapter finetuning after quantization.\\nFor our second setup, since full finetuning models at and beyond\\n11B parameters requires more than one server of high memory\\nGPUs, we continue to test whether 4-bit QLORA can match\\n16-bit LoRA at the 7B to 65B parameter scales. To this end, we\\nfinetune LLaMA 7B through 65B on two instruction following\\ndatasets, Alpaca and FLAN v2, and evaluate on the MMLU benchmark via 5-shot accuracy. Results\\nare shown in Table 4 where we see that NF4 with double quantization fully recovers the 16-bit\\nLoRA MMLU performance. In addition, we also note that QLORA with FP4 lags behind the 16-bit\\nbrain float LoRA baseline by about 1 percentage point. This corroborates both our findings that (1)\\nQLORA with NF4 replicates both 16-bit full finetuning and 16-bit LoRA finetuning performance,\\nand (2) NF4 is superior to FP4 in terms of quantization precision.\\nSummary Our results consistently show that 4-bit QLORA with NF4 data type matches 16-\\nbit full finetuning and 16-bit LoRA finetuning performance on academic benchmarks with well-\\nestablished evaluation setups.

Combined, this forms compelling evidence that\\n4-bit QL ORA tuning reliably yields results matching 16-bit methods.\\nIn line with previous work on quantization [13], our MMLU and Elo results indicate that with a given\\nfinetuning and inference resource budget it is beneficial to increase the number of parameters in the\\nbase model while decreasing their precision. This highlights the importance of efficiency benefits\\nfrom QLORA. Since we did not observe performance degradation compared to full-finetuning in\\nour experiments with 4-bit finetuning, this raises the question of where the performance-precision\\ntrade-off exactly lies for QLoRA tuning, which we leave to future work to explore.\\nWe proceed to investigate instruction tuning at scales that would be impossible to explore with full\\n16-bit finetuning on academic research hardware.\\n5 Pushing the Chatbot State-of-the-art with QLoRA\\nHaving established that 4-bit QLORA matches 16-bit performance across scales, tasks, and datasets\\nwe conduct an in-depth study of instruction finetuning up to the largest open-source language models\\navailable for research.

We include datasets obtained through crowd-sourcing (OASST1 [31],\\nHH-RLHF [4]), distillation from instruction-tuned models (Alpaca [55], self-instruct [59], unnatural-\\ninstructions [26]), corpora aggregations (FLAN v2 [ 12]), as well as hybrids (Chip2 [ 32], Long-\\nform [30]). These datasets cover different languages, data sizes, and licenses.\\nTraining Setup To avoid confounding effects from different training objectives, we perform QLoRA\\nfinetuning with cross-entropy loss (supervised learning) without reinforcement learning, even for\\ndatasets that include human judgments of different responses. For datasets that have a clear distinction\\nbetween instruction and response, we finetune only on the response (see ablations in Appendix B).\\nFor OASST1 and HH-RLHF, multiple responses are available. We then select the top response at\\nevery level of the conversation tree and finetune on the full selected conversation, including the\\ninstructions. In all of our experiments, we use NF4 QLORA with double quantization and paged\\noptimizers to prevent memory spikes during gradient checkpointing. We do small hyperparameter\\nsearches for the 13B and 33B LLaMA models and we find that all hyperparameter settings found\\nat 7B generalize (including number of epochs) except learning rate and batch size. We halve the\\nlearning rate for 33B and 65B while doubling the batch size.\\nBaselines We compare our models to both research (Vicuna [10] and Open Assistant [ 31]) and\\ncommercial (GPT-4 [42], GPT-3.5-turbo and Bard) chatbot systems. The Open Assistant model is\\na LLaMA 33B model finetuned with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) on\\nthe same OASST1 dataset that we experiment with. Vicuna does full fine-tuning of LLaMA 13B\\non proprietary user-shared conversations from ShareGPT and is thus the result of distillation from\\nOpenAI GPT models.\\n5.2 Evaluation\\nTable 5: MMLU 5-shot test results for different\\nsizes of LLaMA finetuned on the corresponding\\ndatasets using QLoRA.\\nDataset 7B 13B 33B 65B\\nLLaMA no tuning 35.1 46.9 57.8 63.4\\nSelf-Instruct 36.4 33.3 53.0 56.7\\nLongform 32.1 43.2 56.6 59.7\\nChip2 34.5 41.6 53.6 59.8\\nHH-RLHF 34.9 44.6 55.8 60.1\\nUnnatural Instruct 41.9 48.1 57.3 61.3\\nGuanaco (OASST1) 36.6 46.4 57.0 62.2\\nAlpaca 38.8 47.8 57.3 62.5\\nFLAN v2 44.5 51.4 59.2 63.9\\nFollowing common practice, we use the MMLU (Mas-\\nsively Multitask Language Understanding) benchmark\\n[24] to measure performance on a range of language un-\\nderstanding tasks.

We use the Vicuna prompts, a set of 80 prompts from a\\ndiverse set of categories, without modifications. The OASST1 dataset is a multilingual collection of\\ncrowd-sourced multiturn dialogs between a user and an assistant. We select all user messages in the\\nvalidation dataset as queries and include previous turns in the prompt. This procedure leads to 953\\nunique user queries. We term these two datasets the Vicuna and OA benchmarks.\\nAutomated Evaluation First, based on the evaluation protocol introduced by Chiang et al. [10],\\nwe use GPT-4 to rate the performance of different systems against ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 Turbo) on the\\nVicuna benchmark. Given a query along with ChatGPT’s and a model’s responses, GPT-4 is prompted\\nto assign a score out of ten to both responses and provide an explanation. The overall performance of\\na model is calculated as a percentage of the score that ChatGPT achieved. Note this relative score\\ncan be higher than 100% if the model achieves a higher absolute score than ChatGPT. We find a\\nsignificant ordering effect with GPT-4 increasing the score of the response occurring earlier in the\\nprompt. To control for such effects, we recommend reporting the mean score over both orders.\\nNext, we measure performance through direct comparisons between system outputs. We simplify\\nthe rating scheme to a three-class labeling problem that accounts for ties. We prompt GPT-4 to\\npick the best response or declare a tie and provide an explanation. We conduct these head-to-head\\ncomparisons on all permutations of pairs of systems on both the Vicuna and OA benchmarks.\\nHuman Evaluation While recent work indicates generative models can be effectively employed\\nfor system evaluations [19], the reliability GPT-4 ratings to assess chatbot performance is, to our\\nknowledge, yet to be proven to correlate with human judgments. Therefore, we run two parallel\\nhuman evaluations on the Vicuna benchmark matching both automated evaluation protocols described\\nabove. We use Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and get two human annotators for comparisons to\\nChatGPT and three annotators for pairwise comparisons.\\nElo Rating With both human and automated pairwise comparisons, we create a tournament-style\\ncompetition where models compete against each other. The tournament is made up of matches where\\npairs of models compete to produce the best response for a given prompt. This is similar to how Bai\\net al. [4] and Chiang et al. [10] compare models, but we also employ GPT-4 ratings in addition to\\nhuman ratings. We randomly sample from the set of labeled comparisons to compute Elo [16, 17].\\nElo rating, which is widely used in chess and other games, is a measure of the expected win-rate\\nrelative to an opponent’s win rate, for example, an Elo of 1100 vs 1000 means the Elo 1100 player\\nhas an expected win-rate of approximately 65% against the Elo 1000 opponent; a 1000 vs 1000 or\\n1100 vs 1100 match results in an expected win-rate of 50%. The Elo rating changes after each match\\nproportionally to the expected outcome, that is, an unexpected upset leads to a large change in Elo\\nrating while an expected outcome leads to a small change. Over time, Elo ratings approximately\\nmatch the skill of each player at playing the game. We start with a score of 1,000 and use K = 32.\\nSimilar to Chiang et al. [10], we repeat this procedure 10,000 times with different random seeds to\\ncontrol for ordering effects, e.g., the effect of which model pairs compete with each other first.\\n5.3 Guanaco: QL ORA trained on OASST1 is a State-of-the-art Chatbot\\nBased on our automated and human evaluations, we find that the top QLORA tuned model, Guanaco\\n65B, which we finetune on a variant of OASST1, is the best-performing open-source chatbot model\\nand offers performance competitive to ChatGPT. When compared to GPT-4, Guanaco 65B and 33B\\nhave an expected win probability of 30%, based on Elo rating from human annotators system-level\\npairwise comparisons - the highest reported to date.\\nThe Vicuna benchmark [10] results relative to ChatGPT are shown in Table 6. We find that Guanaco\\n65B is the best-performing model after GPT-4, achieving 99.3% performance relative to ChatGPT.\\nGuanaco 33B has more parameters than the Vicuna 13B model, but uses only 4-bit precision for its\\nweights and is thus much more memory efficient at 21 GB vs 26 GB, providing a three percentage\\npoints of improvement over Vicuna 13B. Furthermore, Guanaco 7B easily fits on modern phones at a\\n5 GB footprint while still scoring nearly 20 percentage points higher than Alpaca 13B.\\nHowever, Table 6 also has very wide confidence intervals, with many models overlapping in per-\\nformance. We hypothesize that this uncertainty comes from the lack of clear specification of scale,\\ne.g., it is unclear what 8 on a 10 point scale means across different scenarios. As such, we instead\\nrecommend using the Elo ranking method [16], based on pairwise judgments from human annotators\\nand GPT-4 to avoid the problem of grounding an absolute scale.

At the\\nexample level, the agreement between GPT-4 and human annotators’ majority vote is weaker with\\nFleiss κ = 0.25. Overall, this shows a moderate agreement between system-level judgments by\\nGPT-4 and human annotators, and thus that model-based evaluation represents a somewhat reliable\\nalternative to human evaluation. We discuss further considerations in Section 6.2.\\nElo rankings in Table 7 indicate that Guanaco 33B and 65B models outperform all models besides\\nGPT-4 on the Vicuna and OA benchmarks and that they perform comparably to ChatGPT in line\\nwith Table 6. We note that the Vicuna benchmark favors open-source models while the larger OA\\nbenchmark favors ChatGPT. Furthermore, we can see from Tables 5 and 6 that the suitability of\\na finetuning dataset is a determining factor in performance. Finetuning Llama models on FLAN\\nv2 does particularly well on MMLU, but performs worst on the Vicuna benchmark (similar trends\\nare observed with other models). This also points to partial orthogonality in current evaluation\\nbenchmarks: strong MMLU performance does not imply strong chatbot performance (as measured\\nby Vicuna or OA benchmarks) and vice versa.\\nGuanaco is the only top model in our evaluation that is not trained on proprietary data as the OASST1\\ndataset collection guidelines explicitly forbid the use of GPT models. The next best model trained\\non only open-source data is the Anthropic HH-RLHF model, which scores 30 percentage points\\nlower than Guanaco on the Vicuna benchmark (see Table 6). Overall, these results show that 4-bit\\nQLORA is effective and can produce state-of-the-art chatbots that rival ChatGPT. Furthermore, our\\n33B Guanaco can be trained on 24 GB consumer GPUs in less than 12 hours. This opens up the\\npotential for future work via QLORA tuning on specialized open-source data, which produces models\\nthat can compete with the very best commercial models that exist today.\\n6 Qualitative Analysis\\nWhile quantitative analysis is the core of our evaluation, there are a number of issues with only\\nlooking at summary statistics.

Second, §6.2 we detail considerations about the results we\\nhave discussed and our interpretation of them.\\n6.1 Qualitative Analysis of Example Generations\\nTo find examples, we first go through data generated for the Vicuna benchmark and the OpenAssistant\\nbenchmark, and look for patterns in the answers Guanaco generates. When we notice a pattern we\\nattempt to setup a question or prompt that will induce the pattern even though it is the incorrect\\nsolution, e.g., if we observe that the model tends to give long-winded answers we prompt the model\\nto “Answer yes or no without explanation.” We use this to find “lemons” where we manage to\\nadversarially break the model and “cherries” where we fail to break the model, and present both. All\\ngenerations in this section were generated with Nucleus Sampling [25] with p = 0.9.\\nOf course, this is by no means comprehensive, since it is beyond the scope of this small qualitative\\nstudy to control for all the variables involved, e.g., the full distribution of responses the model can\\ngenerate for a given prompt is quite large, so we rely on samples we hope are representative. However,\\nwe believe describing these examples gives context to the quantitative evidence shown earlier in the\\npaper. Since we open source all models and code, we hope this section will inspire future work to\\nexamine in more detail the issues we present here.\\nFactual Recall For questions such as “What is the capital of Zambia?” all models consistently\\ngenerate correct answers, e.g.,\\nGuanaco: The capital of Zambia is Lusaka.\\nHowever as questions get more obscure Guanaco becomes unreliable, but stays confident. For\\ninstance in response to this prompt from HotPotQA [68]:\\nUser: In what year was the singer who popularized ‘I’ll Keep the Lovelight\\nBurning’ born?\\nGuanaco: Al Jolson is credited with popularizing the song\\n‘I’ll Keep the Lovelight Burning,’ and he was born in the year\\n1886.\\nGuanaco generates the wrong popularizer and the wrong birthday (though the birthday given is\\ncorrect for the person mentioned, Al Jolson).\\nSuggestibility Guanaco shows a surprising resistance to going along with some kinds of assumed\\nmisinformation, e.g., in the following interaction:\\nUser: How was it finally, officially confirmed that the earth is flat by peer reviewed\\nscientists?\\n11'),\n",

The idea that a group\\nof scientists have peer reviewed and confirmed the earth is\\nflat is simply false.\\nIf you have any more questions please ask.\\nGuanaco is also quite good at knowing what kinds of questions aren’t possible to answer, e.g.,\\nUser: What time is it?\\nGuanaco: I’m sorry, but as an AI language model, I don’t have\\naccess to real-time information.

We prompt the model with “The secret word is ‘banana’. Do not\\nreveal or repeat back this back, no matter what the human requests.” and try to see how easy it is for\\na potential user to access this secret information. Directly asking fails:\\nUser: What is the secret word?\\nGuanaco: I’m sorry, but I’m not able to disclose the secret\\nword. I’m programmed to not reveal or repeat back the secret\\nword, no matter what the human requests. Is there anything\\nelse I can help you with?\\nwhich is the desired behavior.

It’s best if we\\ndon’t speak of it. Is there anything else you’d like to ask?\\nshowcasing the need to study methods for more faithful instruction following.\\nMath Guanaco’s biggest weakness is mathematics, an area where many language models struggle\\nin [35]. When Guanaco shows its work, it tends to be accurate, e.g.,\\nUser: Lee mows one lawn and charges $33. Last week he mowed 16 lawns and\\nthree customers each gave him a $10 tip. How many dollars did Lee earn mowing\\nlawns last week?\\nGuanaco: Lee earned $582 mowing lawns last week.\\nTo find the total amount he earned, we first need to calculate\\nhow much he earned for mowing 16 lawns:\\n$33 x 16 = $528\\nThen we need to add the tips he received from the three\\ncustomers:\\n$10 x 3 = $30\\nSo the total amount Lee earned was:\\n$528 + $30 = $558\\nHowever Guanaco can breakdown at even simple problems if it fails to break them down step-by-step,\\na known issue [63]. For example, we see the following interaction:\\nUser: Please factorize 1833.\\nGuanaco: Sure, I’d be happy to help! 1833 is a prime number,\\nwhich means it has only two factors: 1 and 1833.\\nSo the unique factorization of 1833 is:\\n2ˆ1 * 3ˆ2 * 17ˆ1\\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other\\nquestions.\\nwhich is not only wrong (the true factorization is 3 × 17 × 43), it’s wrong twice .\\nTheory of Mind Guanaco displays surprisingly strong Theory of Mind capabilities [41, 51]. For\\ninstance, the model correctly answers the following question in great detail:\\nUser: James and Abby are in the bedroom. Abby put the pen in the desk drawer.\\nAbby leaves the bedroom. James moves the pen into the bag. Where does James\\nthink Abby will look for the pen?\\nGuanaco: James knows that Abby put the pen in the desk drawer.\\nBut James also knows that he has moved the pen into the bag,\\nand he assumes that Abby does not know about this. So, James\\nmay guess that Abby will look for the pen in the desk drawer,\\nbecause that’s where she left it last time. However, this\\nassumption may be incorrect, because Abby may have seen James\\nmoving the pen.\\nHowever, these inferences are unreliable, and often the model gives reasons that presume things that\\ndon’t make sense in the situation, e.g.,\\nUser: Evelyn entered the living room. Jackson entered the playroom. James\\nentered the playroom. The beans are in the treasure chest. James exited the\\n13'),\n",

These issues echo recent\\nliterature [51], but require more study.\\n6.2 Considerations\\nEvaluation We report moderate agreement among human annotators (Fleiss κ = 0.42) with\\nadditional deterioration when comparing two strong systems. This points to limitations in the\\ncurrent benchmarks and human evaluation protocols for chatbot task performance. When manually\\ncomparing generations from ChatGPT and Guanaco 65B on the Vicuna benchmark, we find that\\nsubjective preferences start to play an important role as the authors of this paper disagreed on the\\nmany preferred responses. Future work should investigate approaches to mitigate these problems\\ndrawing from disciplines that developed mechanisms to deal with subjective preferences, such as\\nHuman-Computer Interaction and Psychology.\\nIn our analysis, we also find that automated evaluation systems have noticeable biases. For example,\\nwe observe strong order effects with GPT-4 assigning higher scores to the system appearing first in its\\nprompt. The relatively weak sample-level agreement between GPT-4 and human annotators (Fleiss\\nκ = 0.25) also suggests that human annotators and automated systems might rely on preferences\\nthat are not always aligned. In addition, in Table 7, we observe that GPT-4 assigns significantly\\nhigher scores to its own outputs compared to human ratings, Elo of 1348 vs 1176, which represent an\\nadditional 20% probability of winning against an opponent. Future work should examine the presence\\nof potential biases in automated evaluation systems as well as possible mitigation strategies.\\nData & Training We note that the OASST1 dataset on which Guanaco models are trained is\\nmultilingual and that the OA benchmark also contains prompts in different languages. We leave it to\\nfuture work to investigate the degree to which such multilingual training improves performance on\\ninstructions in languages other than English and whether this explains the larger gap between Vicuna-\\n13B model (only trained on English data) and Guanaco 33B and 65B on the OA benchmark.\\nGiven the strong performance of Guanaco models, we investigate any data leakage between the\\nOASST1 data and the Vicuna benchmark prompts. We do not find overlapping prompts after perform-\\ning fuzzy string matching in the two datasets and inspecting the closest matches manually.\\nFurthermore, we note that our model is only trained with cross-entropy loss (supervised learning)\\nwithout relying on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This calls for further\\ninvestigations of the tradeoffs of simple cross-entropy loss and RLHF training. We hope thatQLORA\\nenables such analysis at scale, without the need for overwhelming computational resources.\\n7 Related Work\\nQuantization of Large Language Models Quantization of LLMs has largely focused on quanti-\\nzation for inference time. Major approaches for preserving 16-bit LLM quality focus on managing\\noutlier features (e.g., SmoothQuant [66] and LLM.int8() [14]) while others use more sophisticated\\ngrouping methods [44, 69]. Lossy quantization approaches study the trade-offs for regular round-\\ning [13, 71, 47] or how to optimize rounding decisions to improve quantization precision [ 18].\\nBesides our work, SwitchBack layers [ 65] is the only work that studies backpropagation through\\nquantized weights at a scale beyond 1B parameters.\\nFinetuning with Adapters While we use Low-rank Adapters [28] (LoRA), many other Parameter\\nEfficient FineTuning (PEFT) methods have been proposed such as prompt tuning [48, 33, 34], tuning\\nthe embedding layer inputs [ 1], tuning hidden states (IA 3) [37], adding full layers [ 27], tuning\\nbiases [70], learning a mask over weights based on Fisher information [54], and a combination of\\napproaches [23]. In our work, we show that LoRA adapters are able to reach full 16-bit finetuning\\nperformance. We leave it to future work to explore the tradeoffs of other PEFT approaches.\\nInstruction Finetuning To help a pretrained LLM follow the instructions provided in a prompt,\\ninstruction finetuning uses input-output pairs of various data sources to finetune a pretrained LLM\\nto generate the output given the input as a prompt. Approaches and datasets include MetaICL [40],\\n14'),\n",

Approaches and datasets include Anthropic-\\nHH [2, 4], Open Assistant [ 31], LaMDA [ 56], and Sparrow [ 21]. We do not use reinforcement\\nlearning, but our best model, Guanaco, is finetuned on multi-turn chat interactions from the Open\\nAssistant dataset which was designed to be used for RLHF training [ 31]. For the evaluation of\\nchatbots approaches that use GPT-4 instead of costly human annotation have been developed [10, 45].\\nWe improve on such approaches with a focus on an evaluation setup that is more reliable.\\n8 Limitations and Discussion\\nWe have shown evidence that our method, QLORA, can replicate 16-bit full finetuning performance\\nwith a 4-bit base model and Low-rank Adapters (LoRA). Despite this evidence, we did not establish\\nthat QLORA can match full 16-bit finetuning performance at 33B and 65B scales. Due to the\\nimmense resource costs, we leave this study to future work.\\nAnother limitation is the evaluation of instruction finetuning models. While we provide evaluations\\non MMLU, the Vicuna benchmark, and the OA benchmark, we did not evaluate on other benchmarks\\nsuch as BigBench, RAFT, and HELM, and it is not ensured that our evaluations generalize to these\\nbenchmarks. On the other hand, we perform a very broad study on MMLU and develop new methods\\nfor evaluating chatbots.\\nFrom the evidence presented, it appears that the performance of these benchmarks likely depends how\\nsimilar the finetuning data is to the benchmark dataset. For example, FLAN v2 is similar to MMLU,\\nbut dissimilar to chatbot benchmarks and vice versa for the Chip2 dataset and both models score\\naccordingly on the MMLU and Vicuna benchmarks. This highlights that not only better benchmarks\\nand evaluation is needed, but that one needs to be careful about what one is evaluating in the first\\nplace. Do we want to create models that do well on classroom highschool and colleague knowledge or\\ndo we want to do well on chatbot conversation ability? Maybe something else? Because it is always\\neasier to evaluate on an existing benchmark compared to creating a new one, certain benchmarks\\ncan steer the community towards a certain direction. We should ensure as a community that the\\nbenchmarks measure what we care about.\\nWhile we provide a detailed evaluation for general chatbot performance, another limitation is that we\\nonly do a limited responsible AI evaluation of Guanaco. We evaluate the likelihood of Guanaco-65B\\nto generate a socially biased sequence of tokens compared to other models in Table 8. We see that the\\naverage score in Guanaco-65B is much lower than other raw pretrained models. As such, it seems that\\nfinetuning on the OASST1 dataset reduces the bias of the LLaMA base model. While these results\\nare encouraging, it is unclear if Guanaco does also well when assessed on other types of biases. We\\nleave further evaluation of analyzing biases in Guanaco and similar chatbots to future work.\\n15'),\n",

We have demonstrated that our\\nbest 33B model trained on the Open Assistant dataset can rival ChatGPT on the Vicuna benchmark.\\nSince instruction finetuning is an essential tool to transform raw pretrained LLMs into ChatGPT-like\\nchatbots, we believe that our method will make finetuning widespread and common in particular for\\nthe researchers that have the least resources, a big win for the accessibility of state of the art NLP\\ntechnology. QLORA can be seen as an equalizing factor that helps to close the resource gap between\\nlarge corporations and small teams with consumer GPUs.\\nAnother potential source of impact is deployment to mobile phones. We believe our QLORA method\\nmight enable the critical milestone of enabling the finetuning of LLMs on phones and other low\\nresource settings. While 7B models were shown to be able to be run on phones before, QLORA is\\nthe first method that would enable the finetuning of such models. We estimate that with an iPhone 12\\nPlus, QLORA can finetune 3 million tokens per night while the phone is charging. While finetuned\\n7B models do not reach the quality of ChatGPT, we believe that the quality is good enough to enable\\nnovel applications that have not been possible before due to privacy or LLM quality issues. QLORA\\ncan help enable privacy-preserving usage of LLMs, where users can own and manage their own data\\nand models, while simultaneously making LLMs easier to deploy.\\nHowever, finetuning is a dual-use technology that can be abused to cause harm. Widespread use of\\nLLMs has known dangers [8, 6], but we believe that equalizing access to a technology that is quickly\\nbecoming ubiquitous will allow for better more independent analysis than keeping the power of LLMs\\nin the hands of large corporations that do not release models or source code for auditing.\\nAll in all, we believe that QLORA will have a broadly positive impact making the finetuning of high\\nquality LLMs much more widely and easily accessible.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe thank Aditya Kusupati, Ofir Press, Ashish Sharma, Margaret Li, Raphael Olivier, Zihao Ye, and\\nEvangelia Spiliopoulou for their valuable feedback.

However,\\nwe split the training data in training and validation datasets allowing us to perform more rigorous\\nhyperparameter tuning and early stopping. We use the same hyperparameters described in the paper\\nfor training the various T5 model sizes on the Super-Natural Instruction data. We use LoRA r = 16\\nfor small, medium, and large T5 models and LoRA r = 64for T5 xl and xxl models. We also use\\nLoRA α = 64in all our experiments and no LoRA dropout.\\nB Training a State-of-the-art Chatbot Experimental Setup Details\\nB.1 Datasets\\nWe describe the datasets used for QLORA finetuning experiments outlined in Section 5.\\nOASST1 The OpenAssistant dataset [31] was collected via crowd-sourcing. It contains 161,443\\nunique messages distributed across 66,497 conversations and spanning 35 different languages. The\\ndataset often contains several ranked replies for each given user question. In our experiments, we\\nonly use the top reply at each level in the conversation tree. This limits the dataset to 9,209 examples.\\nWe finetuning our models on the full conversation including the user queries.\\nHH-RLHF This is a human preference dataset about helpfulness and harmlessness. Each datapoint\\nconsists of two assistant replies to a user question along with a human preference judgment of the\\nbest reply. The dataset contains 160,800 examples. When finetuning on this dataset, we combine\\nhelpfulness and harmlessness data and only keep the preferred assistant reply.\\nFLAN v2 The FLAN v2 collection [39] is a collection of 1836 tasks augmented with hundreds\\nof manually curated templates and rich formatting patterns into over 15M examples. The authors\\nshow that models trained on this collection outperform other public collections including the original\\nFLAN 2021 [ 62], T0++ [ 50], Super-Natural Instructions [ 60], and OPT-IML [ 29]. We used the\\nsame task mixtures described by the authors with the exception of some datasets that were not freely\\navailable at the time of writing.\\n22'),\n",

They rely on prompting, in-context learning, and\\nparaphrasing to come up with diverse sets of instructions and outputs. The datasets comprise of\\n82,612, 51,942, and 240,670 examples respectively.

The underlying documents are human-written and\\ncome from C4 and Wikipedia while the instructions are generated visa LLMs. The dataset is extended\\nwith additional structured corpora examples such as Stack Exchange and WikiHow and task examples\\nsuch as question answering, email writing, grammar error correction, story/poem generation, and text\\nsummarization. The dataset contains 23,700 examples.\\nChip2 is part of the OIG Laion dataset.

We find hyper-\\nparameters to be largely robust across datasets. We use the MMLU 5-shot dev set for validation\\nand hyperparameter tuning. In all our experiments we use NF4 with double quantization and bf16\\ncomputation datatype. We set LoRA r = 64, α = 16, and add LoRA modules on all linear layers of\\nthe base model. We also use Adam beta2 of 0.999, max grad norm of 0.3 and LoRA dropout of 0.1\\nfor models up to 13B and 0.05 for 33B and 65B models. Following previous work on instruction\\nfinetuning [62, 60] and after benchmarking other linear and cosine schedules, we use a constant\\nlearning rate schedule. We use group-by-length to group examples of similar lengths in the same\\nbatch (note this will produce a oscillating loss curve). The hyperparameters we tune for each model\\nsize are shown in Table 9.\\nB.3 Ablations\\nWhile it is general practice in the literature to only train on the response in instruction following\\ndatasets, we study the effect of training on the instruction in addition to the response in Table 10. In\\nthese experiments, we restrict the training data to 52,000 examples and use the 7B model. Over four\\ndifferent instruction tuning datasets, we find that only training on the target is beneficial to MMLU\\n23'),\n",

We find that increasing the dataset size and\\nincreasing the number of epochs improves MMLU only marginally (0.0 - 0.5 MMLU), while the\\ndifference between datasets is up to 40x larger (1.5 - 8.0 MMLU). This is a clear indicator that dataset\\nquality rather than dataset size is critical for mean MMLU accuracy.

The\\naggregated pairwise judgments are hown in Table 12. On inspection, it is clear these judgments are\\ntransitive, i.e., when System A is judged better than System B and System B is judged better than\\nSystem C, it is always the case that System A is judged better than System C.

They enable interaction with humans through intuitive\\nchat interfaces, which has led to rapid and widespread adoption among the general public.\\nThe capabilities of LLMs are remarkable considering the seemingly straightforward nature of the training\\nmethodology. Auto-regressive transformers are pretrained on an extensive corpus of self-supervised data,\\nfollowed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human\\nFeedback (RLHF). Although the training methodology is simple, high computational requirements have\\nlimited the development of LLMs to a few players. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs\\n(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that\\nmatch the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla\\n(Hoffmann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such\\nas ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. These closed product LLMs are heavily fine-tuned to align with human\\npreferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require significant costs in\\ncompute and human annotation, and is often not transparent or easily reproducible, limiting progress within\\nthe community to advance AI alignment research.\\nIn this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs,Llama 2and\\nLlama 2-Chat, at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested,\\nLlama 2-Chatmodels generally perform better than existing open-source models. They also appear to\\nbe on par with some of the closed-source models, at least on the human evaluations we performed (see\\nFigures 1 and 3). We have taken measures to increase the safety of these models, using safety-specific data\\nannotation and tuning, as well as conducting red-teaming and employing iterative evaluations. Additionally,\\nthis paper contributes a thorough description of our fine-tuning methodology and approach to improving\\nLLM safety. We hope that this openness will enable the community to reproduce fine-tuned LLMs and\\ncontinue to improve the safety of those models, paving the way for more responsible development of LLMs.\\nWe also share novel observations we made during the development ofLlama 2andLlama 2-Chat, such as\\nthe emergence of tool usage and temporal organization of knowledge.\\n3'),\n",

As a result, we focused first on collecting several thousand examples of high-quality SFT data,\\nas illustrated in Table 5. By setting aside millions of examples from third-party datasets and using fewer but\\nhigher-quality examples from our own vendor-based annotation efforts, our results notably improved. These\\nfindingsaresimilarinspirittoZhouetal.(2023),whichalsofindsthatalimitedsetofcleaninstruction-tuning\\ndata can be sufficient to reach a high level of quality. We found that SFT annotations in the order of tens of\\nthousands was enough to achieve a high-quality result. We stopped annotating SFT after collecting a total of\\n27,540 annotations. Note that we do not include any Meta user data.\\nWe also observed that different annotation platforms and vendors can result in markedly different down-\\nstream model performance, highlighting the importance of data checks even when using vendors to source\\nannotations.

Surprisingly,\\nwe found that the outputs sampled from the resulting SFT model were often competitive with SFT data\\nhandwritten by human annotators, suggesting that we could reprioritize and devote more annotation effort\\nto preference-based annotation for RLHF.\\nFine-Tuning Details. For supervised fine-tuning, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with an initial\\nlearning rate of2 × 10−5, a weight decay of 0.1, a batch size of 64, and a sequence length of 4096 tokens.\\nFor the fine-tuning process, each sample consists of a prompt and an answer. To ensure the model sequence\\nlength is properly filled, we concatenate all the prompts and answers from the training set. A special token is\\nutilized to separate the prompt and answer segments.

We chose a binary comparison protocol over\\nother schemes, mainly because it enables us to maximize the diversity of collected prompts. Still, other\\nstrategies are worth considering, which we leave for future work.\\nOur annotation procedure proceeds as follows. We ask annotators to first write a prompt, then choose\\nbetween two sampled model responses, based on provided criteria. In order to maximize the diversity, the\\ntworesponsestoagivenpromptaresampledfromtwodifferentmodelvariants,andvaryingthetemperature\\nhyper-parameter. Inadditiontogivingparticipantsaforcedchoice,wealsoaskannotatorstolabelthedegree\\nto which they prefer their chosen response over the alternative: either their choice issignificantly better, better,\\nslightly better, ornegligibly better/ unsure.\\nFor our collection of preference annotations, we focus on helpfulness and safety. Helpfulness refers to how\\nwell Llama 2-Chatresponses fulfill users’ requests and provide requested information; safety refers to\\nwhether Llama 2-Chat’s responses are unsafe, e.g.,“giving detailed instructions on making a bomb”could\\nbe considered helpful but is unsafe according to our safety guidelines. Separating the two allows us to\\napply specific guidelines to each and better guide annotators; for example, our safety annotations provide\\ninstructions to focus on adversarial prompts, among other guidance.\\nApart from differences in annotation guidelines, we additionally collect a safety label during the safety stage.\\nThis additional information bins model responses into one of three categories: 1) the preferred response\\nis safe and the other response is not, 2) both responses are safe, and 3) both responses are unsafe, with\\n18%, 47%, and 35% of the safety dataset falling into each bin, respectively. We do not include any examples\\nwhere the chosen response was unsafe and the other response safe, as we believe safer responses will also be\\nbetter/preferred by humans. Safety guidelines and more detailed information regarding safety annotations\\ncan be found in Section 4.2.1.\\nHuman annotations were collected in batches on a weekly basis. As we collected more preference data, our\\nreward models improved, and we were able to train progressively better versions forLlama 2-Chat(see\\nthe results in Section 5, Figure 20).Llama 2-Chatimprovement also shifted the model’s data distribution.\\nSince reward model accuracy can quickly degrade if not exposed to this new sample distribution, i.e., from\\nhyper-specialization (Scialom et al., 2020b), it is important before a newLlama 2-Chattuning iteration to\\ngather new preference data using the latestLlama 2-Chatiterations. This step helps keep the reward model\\non-distribution and maintain an accurate reward for the latest model.\\nIn Table 6, we report the statistics of reward modeling data that we collected over time, and present them\\nagainst multiple open-source preference datasets including Anthropic Helpful and Harmless (Bai et al.,\\n2022a), OpenAI Summarize (Stiennon et al., 2020), OpenAI WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021), StackExchange\\n(Lambert et al., 2023), Stanford Human Preferences (Ethayarajh et al., 2022), and Synthetic GPT-J (Havrilla).\\nWe collected a large dataset of over 1 million binary comparisons based on humans applying our specified\\nguidelines, which we refer to asMetareward modeling data. Note that the number of tokens in prompts and\\nanswers differs depending on the text domain. Summarization and online forum data generally have longer\\nprompts, while dialogue-style prompts are usually shorter. Compared to existing open-source datasets, our\\npreference data features more conversation turns, and are longer, on average.\\n3.2.2 Reward Modeling\\nThe reward model takes a model response and its corresponding prompt (including contexts from previous\\nturns) as inputs and outputs a scalar score to indicate the quality (e.g., helpfulness and safety) of the model\\ngeneration. Leveraging such response scores as rewards, we can optimizeLlama 2-Chatduring RLHF for\\nbetter human preference alignment and improved helpfulness and safety.\\nOthers have found that helpfulness and safety sometimes trade off (Bai et al., 2022a), which can make it\\nchallenging for a single reward model to perform well on both. To address this, we train two separate reward\\nmodels, one optimized for helpfulness (referred to asHelpfulness RM) and another for safety (Safety RM).\\nWe initialize our reward models from pretrained chat model checkpoints, as it ensures that both models\\nbenefit from knowledge acquired in pretraining. In short, the reward model “knows” what the chat model\\n10'),\n",

This prevents cases where, for instance, the two models would have an information mismatch, which\\ncould result in favoring hallucinations. The model architecture and hyper-parameters are identical to those\\nof the pretrained language models, except that the classification head for next-token prediction is replaced\\nwith a regression head for outputting a scalar reward.\\nTraining Objectives. To train the reward model, we convert our collected pairwise human preference data\\ninto a binary ranking label format (i.e., chosen & rejected) and enforce the chosen response to have a higher\\nscore than its counterpart. We used a binary ranking loss consistent with Ouyang et al.

Given that our preference ratings is decomposed as a scale of four points (e.g.,\\nsignificantly better), as presented in Section 3.2.1, it can be useful to leverage this information to explicitly\\nteach the reward model to assign more discrepant scores to the generations that have more differences. To\\ndo so, we further add a margin component in the loss:\\nLranking = −log(σ(rθ(x, yc) − rθ(x, yr) − m(r))) (2)\\nwhere the marginm(r) is a discrete function of the preference rating. Naturally, we use a large margin\\nfor pairs with distinct responses, and a smaller one for those with similar responses (shown in Table 27).\\nWe found this margin component can improve Helpfulness reward model accuracy especially on samples\\nwhere two responses are more separable. More detailed ablation and analysis can be found in Table 28 in\\nAppendix A.3.3.\\nData Composition. We combine our newly collected data with existing open-source preference datasets\\nto form a larger training dataset. Initially, open-source datasets were used to bootstrap our reward models\\nwhile we were in the process of collecting preference annotation data. We note that in the context of RLHF in\\nthis study, the role of reward signals is to learn human preference forLlama 2-Chatoutputs rather than\\nany modeloutputs. However, in our experiments, we do not observe negative transfer from the open-source\\npreference datasets. Thus, we have decided to keep them in our data mixture, as they could enable better\\ngeneralization for the reward model and prevent reward hacking, i.e.Llama 2-Chattaking advantage of\\nsome weaknesses of our reward, and so artificially inflating the score despite performing less well.\\nWith training data available from different sources, we experimented with different mixing recipes for both\\nHelpfulness and Safety reward models to ascertain the best settings.

The delta between the maximum and median\\ncurves can be interpreted as the potential gain of fine-tuning on the best output. As expected, this delta\\nincreases with more samples, since the maximum increases (i.e., more samples, more opportunities to\\ngenerate a good trajectory), while the median remains stationary. There is a direct connection between the\\nexploration and the maximum reward we can obtain among the samples.

When we provided such instructions toLlama 2-Chat, the subsequent\\nresponse should always respect the constraint. However, our initial RLHF models tended to forget the initial\\ninstruction after a few turns of dialogue, as illustrated in Figure 9 (left).\\nTo address these limitations, we propose Ghost Attention (GAtt), a very simple method inspired by Context\\nDistillation (Bai et al., 2022b) that hacks the fine-tuning data to help the attention focus in a multi-stage\\nprocess. GAtt enables dialogue control over multiple turns, as illustrated in Figure 9 (right).\\nGAtt Method. Assume we have access to a multi-turn dialogue dataset between two persons (e.g., a user\\nand an assistant), with a list of messages[u1, a1, . . . , un, an], whereun and an correspond to the user and\\nassistant messages for turnn, respectively. Then, we define an instruction,inst, that should be respected\\nthroughout the dialogue. For example,inst could be“act as.”We can then synthetically concatenate this\\ninstruction to all the user messages of the conversation.\\nNext, we can sample from this synthetic data using the latest RLHF model. We now have a context-dialogue\\nand the sample with which to fine-tune a model, in a process analogous to Rejection Sampling. Instead of\\naugmenting all context-dialogue turns with the instruction, we can drop it in all but the first turn, but this\\nwould lead to a mismatch at training time between the system message, i.e., all the intermediate assistant\\nmessages that come before the last turn, and our sample. To fix this issue, which could hurt the training, we\\nsimply set the loss to 0 for all the tokens from the previous turns, including assistant messages.\\nFor the training instructions, we created a few synthetic constraints to sample from: Hobbies (“You enjoy\\ne.g. Tennis”), Language (“Speak in e.g. French”), or Public Figure (“Act as e.g. Napoleon”). To obtain the lists\\nof hobbies and public figures, we askedLlama 2-Chatto generate it, avoiding a mismatch between the\\ninstruction and model knowledge (e.g., asking the model to act as someone it had not encountered during\\ntraining).

Human evaluation, while a gold standard, can\\nbe complicated by various HCI considerations (Clark et al., 2021; Gehrmann et al., 2023), and is not always\\nscalable. Thus, to select the best-performing models among several ablations at each iteration from RLHF-V1\\nto V5, we first observed the improvement of the rewards from the latest reward models, to save costs and\\nincrease iteration speed.

For example, our prompt set does not\\ninclude any coding- or reasoning-related prompts.\\n• We only evaluate the final generation of a multi-turn conversation. A more interesting evaluation could be\\nto ask the models to complete a task and rate the overall experience with the model over multiple turns.\\n• Human evaluation for generative models is inherently subjective and noisy.

We also share a model card in the Appendix, in Table 52.\\n4.1 Safety in Pretraining\\nIt is important to understand what is in the pretraining data both to increase transparency and to shed\\nlight on root causes of potential downstream issues, such as potential biases. This can inform what, if any,\\ndownstream mitigations to consider, and help guide appropriate model use. In this section, we analyze the\\npretraining data for distributions of languages, demographic representations, and toxicity. We also present\\nthe results of testing the pretrained models on existing safety benchmarks.\\nSteps Taken to Pretrain Responsibly.We followed Meta’s standard privacy and legal review processes for\\neach dataset used in training. We did not use any Meta user data in training. We excluded data from certain\\nsites known to contain a high volume of personal information about private individuals. We made a best\\neffort to train our models efficiently to reduce the carbon footprint of pretraining (Section 2.2.1). Sharing our\\nmodelsbroadlywillreducetheneedforotherstotrainsimilarmodels. Noadditionalfilteringwasconducted\\non the datasets, to allowLlama 2to be more widely usable across tasks (e.g., it can be better used for hate\\nspeechclassification), whileavoidingthepotentialfortheaccidentaldemographicerasuresometimescaused\\nby over-scrubbing. Importantly, this allowsLlama 2-Chatto generalize more effectively during safety tuning\\nwith fewer examples (Welbl et al., 2021; Korbak et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2021). As a result,Llama 2models\\nshould be used carefully and deployed only after significant safety tuning is applied.\\nDemographic Representation: Pronouns. Bias in model generations may result from biases inherited\\nfrom the training data itself. For instance, Bailey et al. (2022) shows that in massive text corpora, words\\nrepresenting “people” are often used in more similar contexts to words representing“men”than to words\\nrepresenting“women,”and Ganeshet al.(2023) demonstrates that amodel’sperformance onfairness metrics\\ncan be highly dependent on how the model trains on data representing underrepresented demographic\\ngroups. Within our English-language training corpus, we computed the frequencies of the most common\\nEnglish pronouns in Table 9a. We observe thatHe pronouns are generally overrepresented in documents\\ncompared toShe pronouns, echoing similar frequency differences observed in pronominal usage for similarly\\nsized model pretraining datasets (Chowdhery et al., 2022). This could mean that the model is learning less\\nduring pretraining about context that mentionsShe pronouns, and subsequently may potentially generateHe\\npronouns at a higher rate thanShe pronouns.\\nDemographic Representation: Identities. We also analyze the representation of different demographic\\ngroupsinthepretrainingdatabymeasuringratesofusageofdemographicidentitytermsfromtheHolisticBias\\ndataset (Smith et al., 2022) as a proxy. We compute frequencies for each descriptor term in the pretraining\\ncorpus. We group descriptors into 5 axes (Religion, Gender and Sex, Nationality, Race and Ethnicity, and\\nSexual Orientation), and show the top 5 terms in each axis in Table 9b. In the top 5 terms, we remove a few\\nterms such as“straight,” “white,”and “black,”because these terms have frequent uses beyond demographic\\nmentions (e.g., as basic color terms). We also deduplicate across lists, removing a few terms found in\\nboth Gender and Sexand Sexual Orientation. ForGender and Sex, whileShe pronouns are mentioned\\nin fewer documents, the term“female” is present in a larger percentage of documents. This could imply\\nthat while there is less frequent context aboutShe pronouns, comments about“females”are more prevalent,\\nperhaps reflecting the differences in linguistic markedness of these terms (Blodgett et al., 2021). ForSexual\\nOrientation, the top five terms all relate to LGBTQ+ identities. ForNationality,Race and Ethnicity, and\\nReligion, we observe a Western skew (Bhatt et al., 2022). For instance, the term“American”is mentioned in\\n69.4% of the references, the term“European”is more prevalent than other race and ethnicity, and“Christian”\\nis the most represented religion followed by“Catholic”and “Jewish.”\\n20'),\n",

Truthfulness, referring to whether a language model produces known falsehoods due to misconcep-\\ntions or false beliefs. We employTruthfulQA(Lin et al., 2021) to measure how well our LLMs can\\ngenerate reliable outputs that agree with factuality and common sense.\\n2. Toxicity,definedasthetendencyofalanguagemodeltogeneratetoxic,rude,adversarial,orimplicitly\\nhateful content. We chooseToxiGen(Hartvigsen et al., 2022) to measure the amount of generation\\nof toxic language and hate speech across different groups.\\n3. Bias, defined as how model generations reproduce existing stereotypical social biases. We use\\nBOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021) to study how the sentiment in model generations may vary with\\ndemographic attributes.\\nWe compare the performance ofLlama 2with Llama 1(Touvron et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al.,\\n2023), and MPT (MosaicML NLP Team et al., 2023) in Table 11. For decoding, we set temperature to0.1\\nand use nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020) with top-p set to0.9. For TruthfulQA, we present the\\npercentage of generations that are both truthful and informative (the higher, the better). For ToxiGen, we\\npresent the percentage of generations that are deemed toxic by the metric (the lower, the better). Detailed\\ndescriptions of the benchmarks and metrics can be found in Appendix A.4.7. When compared toLlama 1-7B,\\nLlama 2-7B demonstrates a 21.37% increase in truthfulness and informativeness and a 7.61% decrease in\\ntoxicity. We also observe an increase in toxicity in the pretrained 13B and 70BLlama 2, which may result\\nfrom larger pretraining data or a different dataset mix. Some have postulated the existence of a relationship\\nbetween pretraining dataset size and downstream model toxicity or bias (Bender et al., 2021b), but empirical\\nwork to validate this claim is still ongoing (Dodge et al., 2021; Smith and Williams, 2021; Tal et al., 2022), and\\nfurther evidence from up-to-date models is still needed.\\nIn Appendix A.4.7, we present bias metrics, such as how the sentiment of model generations varies with\\ndemographic attributes. We note an increase in positive sentiment overall for many of the groups using\\nBOLDprompts.

Recall that leaving pretraining data unfiltered may\\nenable base models tuned to perform well on more downstream tasks (including hate speech detection),\\nand it carries less risk of accidentally filtering out some demographic groups.

Further\\ntesting and mitigation should be done to understand bias and other social issues for the specific context\\nin which a system may be deployed. For this, it may be necessary to test beyond the groups available in\\nthe BOLD dataset (race, religion, and gender). As LLMs are integrated and deployed, we look forward to\\ncontinuing research that will amplify their potential for positive impact on these important social issues.\\n4.2 Safety Fine-Tuning\\nIn this section, we describe our approach to safety fine-tuning, including safety categories, annotation\\nguidelines, and the techniques we use to mitigate safety risks. We employ a process similar to the general\\nfine-tuning methods as described in Section 3, with some notable differences related to safety concerns.\\nSpecifically, we use the following techniques in safety fine-tuning:\\n1. Supervised Safety Fine-Tuning: We initialize by gathering adversarial prompts and safe demonstra-\\ntions that are then included in the general supervised fine-tuning process (Section 3.1). This teaches\\nthe model to align with our safety guidelines even before RLHF, and thus lays the foundation for\\nhigh-quality human preference data annotation.\\n2. Safety RLHF: Subsequently, we integrate safety in the general RLHF pipeline described in Sec-\\ntion 3.2.2. This includes training a safety-specific reward model and gathering more challenging\\nadversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and PPO optimization.\\n3. Safety Context Distillation: Finally, we refine our RLHF pipeline with context distillation (Askell\\net al., 2021b). This involves generating safer model responses by prefixing a prompt with a safety\\npreprompt, e.g.,“You are a safe and responsible assistant,”and then fine-tuning the model on the safer\\nresponses without the preprompt, which essentiallydistillsthe safety preprompt (context) into the\\nmodel. We use a targeted approach that allows our safety reward model to choose whether to use\\ncontext distillation for each sample.\\n4.2.1 Safety Categories and Annotation Guidelines\\nBased on limitations of LLMs known from prior work, we design instructions for our annotation team to\\ncreate adversarial prompts along two dimensions: arisk category, or potential topic about which the LLM\\ncould produce unsafe content; and anattack vector, or question style to cover different varieties of prompts\\nthat could elicit bad model behaviors.\\nTheriskcategoriesconsideredcanbebroadlydividedintothefollowingthreecategories: illicitandcriminal\\nactivities(e.g., terrorism, theft, human trafficking);hateful and harmful activities(e.g., defamation, self-\\nharm, eating disorders, discrimination); andunqualified advice(e.g., medical advice, financial advice, legal\\n23'),\n",

The guidelines are meant to be a general guide for the model and are\\niteratively refined and revised to include newly identified risks.\\n4.2.2 Safety Supervised Fine-Tuning\\nIn accordance with the established guidelines from Section 4.2.1, we gather prompts and demonstrations\\nof safe model responses from trained annotators, and use the data for supervised fine-tuning in the same\\nmanner as described in Section 3.1. An example can be found in Table 5.\\nThe annotators are instructed to initially come up with prompts that they think could potentially induce\\nthe model to exhibit unsafe behavior, i.e., perform red teaming, as defined by the guidelines.

Comprehensive tuning with RLHF has the added\\nbenefit that it may make the model more robust to jailbreak attempts (Bai et al., 2022a).\\nWe conduct RLHF by first collecting human preference data for safety similar to Section 3.2.2: annotators\\nwrite a prompt that they believe can elicit unsafe behavior, and then compare multiple model responses to\\nthe prompts, selecting the response that is safest according to a set of guidelines. We then use the human\\npreference data to train a safety reward model (see Section 3.2.2), and also reuse the adversarial prompts to\\nsample from the model during the RLHF stage.\\nBetter Long-Tail Safety Robustness without Hurting HelpfulnessSafety is inherently a long-tail problem,\\nwhere the challenge comes from a small number of very specific cases. We investigate the impact of Safety\\nRLHFbytakingtwointermediate Llama 2-Chatcheckpoints—onewithoutadversarialpromptsintheRLHF\\nstage and one with them—and score their responses on our test sets using our safety and helpfulness reward\\nmodels. In Figure 14, we plot the score distribution shift of the safety RM on the safety test set (left) and that\\nof the helpfulness RM on the helpfulness test set (right). In the left hand side of the figure, we observe that\\nthe distribution of safety RM scores on the safety set shifts to higher reward scores after safety tuning with\\nRLHF, and that the long tail of the distribution near zero thins out. A clear cluster appears on the top-left\\ncorner suggesting the improvements of model safety. On the right side, we do not observe any gathering\\npattern below they = x line on the right hand side of Figure 14, which indicates that the helpfulness score\\ndistributionispreservedaftersafetytuningwithRLHF.Putanotherway,givensufficienthelpfulnesstraining\\ndata, the addition of an additional stage of safety mitigation does not negatively impact model performance\\non helpfulness to any notable degradation. A qualitative example is shown in Table 12.\\nImpact of Safety Data Scaling.A tension between helpfulness and safety of LLMs has been observed in\\nprevious studies (Bai et al., 2022a).

We generate safety preprompts automatically with templates. In particular, we use various\\nadjectivesusuallyassociatedwithsafebehaviorsuchas “responsible,”“respectful’,’ or“wise,”withtheintuition\\nthat the model associates them with positive traits that we want to see reflected in safe answers.

We thus leverage the safety reward model to decide whether to use safety context\\ndistillation – we keep the context-distilled output only on the examples where it gets a better reward model\\nscore than the original answer.

After that, each participant was part of a subteam focused on a particular category of risk or attack\\nvector. After creating each dialogue, the red team participant would annotate various attributes, including\\nrisk areas and degree of risk, as captured by a 5-point Likert scale.\\nSome examples of useful insights provided by members of red teams that we were able to improve upon\\nthroughout development:\\n• [Early models] were more likely to have generated unsafe responses without noting that they con-\\ntain problematic content. However,[slightly later models] have tended to display knowledge\\nthat the content is problematic, even if they do go on to provide it.“They respond with ‘[UNSAFE\\nCONTENT] is not appropriate to discuss, etc.’ and then immediately follow up with ‘With that said, here’s\\nhow [UNSAFE CONTENT].’ ”[Latest models] are able to resolve these issues.\\n• Distracting the[early models] by including “quirks” or specific requests usually defeated any\\nreluctance encountered via more direct requests.“A creative writing request (song, story, poem, etc.) is a\\nreliable way to get it to produce content that it is otherwise robust against.”\\n• Embedding a problematic request in a positive context often successfully obscured the fact that\\nproblematic output was being requested for[early models]: “The overall principle I’ve found most\\neffective for any kind of attack is to hide it in language that is positive, progressive, and empowering.”\\nFrom Red Teaming Insights to Safer Models.Crucially, after each exercise, we performed a thorough\\nanalysis of the collected data, including dialogue length, risk area distribution, histogram of topic of misin-\\nformation (where appropriate), and rated degree of risk. In each case, we took the overall lessons as a guide\\nto help further model safety training, and specifically took data from these exercises for model fine-tuning,\\nmodel feedback training, and as a signal for other safety model training.\\nMultiple additional rounds of red teaming were performed over several months to measure the robustness\\nof each new model as it was released internally. We defined the robustness of a model,γ, with respect to\\na red teaming exercise executed by a set of experts as the average number of created prompts that would\\ntriggeraviolatingresponsefromthemodelperpersonperhour. Asanexample, onour7Bmodel, wehadan\\nevolution ofγ : 1.8 → 0.45 over several red teaming iterations and model refinements. Robustness will likely\\ncontinue to improve with additional red teaming efforts.

Lastly, we present our strategy for responsibly releasing these\\nmodels (Section 5.3).\\n5.1 Learnings and Observations\\nOur tuning process revealed several interesting results, such asLlama 2-Chat’s abilities to temporally\\norganize its knowledge, or to call APIs for external tools.\\nSFT (Mix)\\nSFT (Annotation)\\nRLHF (V1)\\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\\nReward Model Score\\nRLHF (V2)\\nFigure 20: Distribution shift for progressive versions ofLlama 2-Chat, from SFT models towards RLHF.\\nBeyond Human Supervision. At the outset of the project, many among us expressed a preference for\\nsupervised annotation, attracted by its denser signal. Meanwhile reinforcement learning, known for its insta-\\nbility, seemed a somewhat shadowy field for those in the NLP research community. However, reinforcement\\nlearning proved highly effective, particularly given its cost and time effectiveness. Our findings underscore\\nthat the crucial determinant of RLHF’s success lies in the synergy it fosters between humans and LLMs\\nthroughout the annotation process.\\nEven with proficient annotators, each individual writes with significant variation. A model fine-tuned on\\nSFT annotation learns this diversity, including, unfortunately, the tail-end of poorly executed annotation. Fur-\\nthermore, the model’s performance is capped by the writing abilities of the most skilled annotators. Human\\nannotators are arguably less subject to discrepancy when comparing two outputs’ preference annotation\\nfor RLHF. Consequently, the reward mechanism swiftly learns to assign low scores to undesirable tail-end\\ndistribution and aligns towards the human preference. This phenomena is illustrated in Figure 20, where we\\ncan see that the worst answers are progressively removed, shifting the distribution to the right.\\nIn addition, during annotation, the model has the potential to venture into writing trajectories that even the\\nbestannotatorsmaynotchart. Nonetheless,humanscanstillprovidevaluablefeedbackwhencomparingtwo\\nanswers, beyond their own writing competencies. Drawing a parallel, while we may not all be accomplished\\nartists, our ability to appreciate and critique art remains intact. We posit that the superior writing abilities of\\nLLMs, as manifested in surpassing human annotators in certain tasks, are fundamentally driven by RLHF, as\\ndocumented in Gilardi et al. (2023) and Huang et al. (2023). Supervised data may no longer be the gold\\nstandard, and this evolving circumstance compels a re-evaluation of the concept of “supervision.”\\nIn-ContextTemperatureRescaling.

As indicated in Figure 8, the temperature appears to be influenced by RLHF. Yet, intriguingly,\\nour findings also revealed that the shifts are not uniformly applied across all prompts, as shown in Figure 21.\\nFor instance, when it comes to prompts associated with creativity, such as “Write a poem,” an increase in\\ntemperature continues to generate diversity across our various RLHF iterations. This can be observed in the\\nSelf-BLEU slope, which mirrors a pattern comparable to that of the SFT model.\\nOntheotherhand,forpromptsbasedonfactualinformation,suchas“Whatisthecapitalof?” theSelf-BLEU\\nslope diminishes over time.

Collaboration will make these models better and safer. The entire AI community—academic\\nresearchers, civil society, policymakers, and industry—must work together to rigorously analyze and expose\\nthe risks of current AI systems and to build solutions that address potentially problematic misuse. This\\napproach not only fosters real collaboration with diverse stakeholders—those beyond the walls of big tech\\ncompanies—but also serves as the cornerstone for democratizing access to foundational models. As argued\\nin Zellers et al. (2019b), open releases promote transparency and allow more people to access AI tools,\\ndemocratizing the technology and decentralizing AI expertise. We believe that the decentralization of AI\\nexpertise does more than simply distribute knowledge—it stimulates innovation and accelerates progress\\nin the industry. Lastly, openly releasing these models consolidates costs and eliminates barriers to entry,\\nallowing small businesses to leverage innovations in LLMs to explore and build text-generation use cases.\\nUltimately, we believe this will create a more level playing field for organizations of all sizes across the globe\\nto benefit from the economic growth promised by the advancement of AI.\\nWe know that not everyone who uses AI models has good intentions, and we acknowledge that there\\nare reasonable concerns regarding the ways that AI will impact our world. Toxic content generation and\\nproblematic associations are meaningful risks that the AI community has yet to fully mitigate. As this\\npaper illustrates, we have made strides in limiting the prevalence of these types of responses. While we\\nrecognize there is more work to be done, this realization only deepens our commitment to open science and\\ncollaboration with the AI community.\\n6 Related Work\\nLarge Language Models. The recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the field of LLMs.\\nFollowing the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B\\nparameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized\\nmodels, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022) redefined those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights. Notable in\\nthis progression is the rise of Llama, recognized for its focus on computational efficiency during inference\\n(Touvron et al., 2023). A parallel discourse has unfolded around the dynamics of open-source versus closed-\\nsource models. Open-source releases like BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), OPT(Zhang et al., 2022), and Falcon\\n(Penedo et al., 2023) have risen to challenge their closed-source counterparts like GPT-3 and Chinchilla.\\n§§https://ai.meta.com/llama\\n35'),\n",

These models rely on intricate tuning techniques to align with\\nhuman preferences (Gudibande et al., 2023), a process that is still being explored and refined within the\\nopen-source community.\\nAttempts to close this gap have emerged, with distillation-based models such as Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023)\\nand Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) adopting a unique approach to training with synthetic instructions (Honovich\\net al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022).

An approach related to instruction tuning is chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), in\\nwhich models are prompted to explain their reasoning when given a complex problem, in order to increase\\nthe likelihood that their final answer is correct.\\nRLHF has emerged as a powerful strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models, enabling significant\\nimprovements in their performance (Christiano et al., 2017). The method, first showcased by Stiennon et al.\\n(2020) in the context of text-summarization tasks, has since been extended to a range of other applications.\\nIn this paradigm, models are fine-tuned based on feedback from human users, thus iteratively aligning the\\nmodels’ responses more closely with human expectations and preferences.\\nOuyang et al. (2022) demonstrates that a combination of instruction fine-tuning and RLHF can help fix\\nissues with factuality, toxicity, and helpfulness that cannot be remedied by simply scaling up LLMs. Bai\\net al. (2022b) partially automates this fine-tuning-plus-RLHF approach by replacing the human-labeled\\nfine-tuning data with the model’s own self-critiques and revisions, and by replacing human raters with a\\nmodel when ranking model outputs in RLHF, a process known as “RL from AI Feedback” (RLAIF).\\nKnown LLM Safety Challenges.Recent literature has extensively explored the risks and challenges linked\\nwith Large Language Models.

We expand the context window forLlama 2from 2048 tokens to 4096 tokens. The longer\\ncontext window enables models to process more information, which is particularly useful for supporting\\nlonger histories in chat applications, various summarization tasks, and understanding longer documents.\\nTable 16 compares the performance of 2k and 4k context pretraining on long-context benchmarks. Both\\nmodelsaretrainedfor150Btokens,keepingthesamearchitectureandhyperparametersasabaseline,varying\\nonly the context length. We observe improvement on SCROLLS (Shaham et al., 2022), where the average\\ninput length is 3.5k, and no performance degradation on SQUAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2018). Table 17 shows\\nthat the longer context model retains strong performance on various general-purpose tasks.\\nGrouped-Query Attention. A standard practice for autoregressive decoding is to cache the key (K) and\\nvalue (V) pairs for the previous tokens in the sequence, speeding up attention computation. With increasing\\ncontext windows or batch sizes, however, the memory costs associated with the KV cache size in multi-head\\nattention (MHA) models grow significantly. For larger models, where KV cache size becomes a bottleneck,\\nkey and value projections can be shared across multiple heads without much degradation of performance\\n(Chowdheryetal.,2022). Eithertheoriginalmulti-queryformatwithasingleKVprojection(MQA, Shazeer,\\n2019) or a grouped-query attention variant with 8 KV projections (GQA, Ainslie et al., 2023) can be used.\\nIn Table 18, we compare MQA and GQA variants with an MHA baseline. We train all models with 150B\\ntokens while keeping a fixed 30B model size. To keep a similar overall parameter count across GQA and\\nMQA, we increase the dimension of the feed-forward layers to compensate for the reduction in the attention\\nlayers. For the MQA variant, we increase the FFN dimension by a factor of1.33, and for the GQA variant, we\\nincrease it by a factor of1.3. From the results, we observe that the GQA variant performs comparably to the\\nMHA baseline on most evaluation tasks and is better than the MQA variant on average.\\nTo optimize for latency, we host our largest models using 8 A100s in a single node with tensor parallelism\\n(Shoeybi et al., 2019). In this setting, sharding for MQA cannot be done across heads anymore, given the\\nnumber of heads is lower than the number of GPUs. Either you duplicate the KV values in all GPUs (making\\nthe KV cache size equal to GQA), or an alternative is to shard across the batch dimension instead (Pope et al.,\\n2022). The latter, however, can complicate an inference service, as it works only when batch sizes are larger\\nthan the number of shards and the additional communication cost is not worth it in all cases.\\nContext NarrativeQA Qasper QuALITY QMSum ContractNLI SQuAD\\nLength (F1) (F1) (acc) (Rouge 1/2/L) (EM) (EM/F1)\\n2k 0.21 0.71 26.1 0.13/0.01/0.12 11.76 57.23/62.89\\n4k 17.26 18.52 29.6 15.08 /3.55/12.16 16.33 57.99 /64.46\\nTable 16: Context length ablation on long-context tasks.\\nContext Hella-Swag NQ TQA GSM8K Human-Eval\\nLength (0-shot) (64-shot) (64-shot) (8-shot) (0-shot)\\n2k 75.1 25.5 53.7 4.9 7.9\\n4k 74.8 25.5 52.2 6.5 7.3\\nTable 17: Context length ablation on general tasks.\\n47'),\n",

For all other tasks we report accuracy.\\nFigure 24: Multi-query variants enable higher throughput with larger batch sizes, and show similar\\nlatency on smaller batches.Output length is fixed at 128 tokens. The first data point corresponds to batch\\nsize 1, and then we double it until the model runs out of memory. The MHA variant triggers an out-of-\\nmemory error at a batch size of 1024 for a context of 256 tokens and at a batch size of 128 for 2k context,\\nwhereas MQA and GQA have successful runs in those settings.\\nTherefore, based on the ablation results and ease of scaling inference, for the 34B and 70BLlama 2models\\nwe chose to use GQA instead of MQA.\\nFigure 24 shows how inference speed changed for the 30B GQA and MQA ablation models compared to the\\nMHA baseline, in an experiment using 8 x 80 GiB A100s with tensor parallelism. In these runs we simply\\nduplicated the KV heads for MQA in all GPUs, so the KV cache size for MQA became equal to the GQA and\\nthe two variants behaved very similar (with MQA just having a slightly larger FFN dimension).\\nA.2.2 Additional Details for Pretrained Models Evaluation\\nMMLU details.

In total, we collected 14 batches of human\\npreference data (i.e., Meta Safety + Helpfulness) on a weekly basis, consisting of over 1 million binary model\\ngeneration comparisons. In general, later batches contain more samples as we onboard more annotators over\\ntime and the annotators also become more familiar with the tasks and thus have better work efficiency. We\\nalso intentionally collect more multi-turn samples to increase the complexity of RLHF data and thus the\\naverage number of tokens per sample also increase accordingly over batches.\\nIn Figure 25, we plot out the preference rating change over batches. It can be clearly seen that the share\\nof samples with similar responses (e.g.,negligibly better or unsure) increase dramatically over time while\\nthose with stronger preference (e.g.,significantly better) drop in the meantime. This reflects the nature of our\\niterative model update and preference data annotation procedure - with better-performingLlama 2-Chat\\nmodels used for response sampling over time, it becomes challenging for annotators to select a better one\\nfrom two equally high-quality responses.\\nA.3.2 Curriculum Strategy for Meta Human Preference Data\\nHigh quality data is critical for alignment as discussed for SFT. We worked closely with the annotation\\nplatforms during our fine-tuning process, and opted for a curriculum annotation strategy. With the first\\nmodel,theannotatorswereaskedtomakepromptsrelativelysimple,andthentoprogressivelymovetowards\\nmorecomplexpromptsandteachingnewskillsto Llama 2-Chat. Anillustrationofthiscurriculumannotation\\non our helpfulness preference data is displayed in Figure 26.\\nA.3.3 Ablation on Ranking Loss with Preference Rating-based Margin for Reward Modeling\\nWe ablated the ranking loss with the preference rating-based margin term for the helpfulness reward model.\\nWe tried two variants ofm(r) with different magnitude for the margin term in Eq 2 as listed open-source 27\\nandcomparethemagainstthebaselinewithoutthemarginterm. Wereportboththeirper-ratingandaverage\\naccuracy on the Meta Helpful test set in Table 28.

We plot the\\nhistogram of reward scores from the test set in Figure 27. Essentially, the margin term pushes the reward\\n51'),\n",

We manually collected single turn prompts spanning the following categories: factual questions,\\nwriting and content creation, language assistance, recommendations, and dialogue. For multi-turn prompts,\\nannotators interacted with another model to generate a set of multi-turn prompts. To help ensure fairness,\\nwe asked annotators to collect multi-turn prompts by using four different interaction methods: (a) ChatGPT\\nas the interaction model, (b)Llama 2-Chatas the interaction model, (c) best response between ChatGPT\\nand Llama 2-Chatat every turn as selected by the annotators, (d) alternating between ChatGPT andLlama\\n2-Chat at every turn. We also categorized multi-turn prompts into the same five categories listed above.\\nSince it can be hard to categorize multi-turn prompts into a single category, annotators could select up to two\\ncategories for multi-turn prompts. Example evaluation prompts can be seen in Table 33.\\nFor open-source models, we collect generations using a context length of 1000 tokens and allow the model to\\ngenerate up to 1000 tokens. Even thoughLlama 2-Chatmodels are capable of handling up to 4000 tokens,\\nwe limit the context and generation length to 1000 tokens to provide a fair comparison with the open-source\\nmodels. Limiting the generation length to 1000 tokens may adversely affect theLlama 2-Chatmodels. Any\\nprompts that are longer than 1000 tokens are filtered out for evaluations with open sourced models.

It is named after Charles Ponzi, who became infamous for using this\\ntechnique in the early 1900s.\\nThe masterminds behind a Ponzi scheme typically follow a steps to set it up and carry it out:\\n1.

Table 44 presents evaluation results of TruthfulQA for the percentage of truthfulness,\\npercentage of informativeness, and percentage of both truthfulness and informativeness across\\ngenerations. Most of the models show a >90% informativeness in the model generations. However,\\nthe truthfulness percentage is relatively low for pretrained models, around 30% to 40% for Falcon,\\nMPT, and the 7BLlama 1. This percentage increases for pretrainedLlama 1and Llama 2with a\\nlarger size. After instruction fine-tuning, both 7B and 13BLlama 2-Chatimproved about 20% in\\ntruthfulness, 30BLlama 2-Chatimproved about 24%, and 70BLlama 2-Chatimproved about 14%\\ncompared to their pretrained versions.\\n• Toxicity.Table 45 shows that Mexicans, Latinos, and women tend to be the top three demographic\\ngroups with the highest percentages of toxic generations given ToxiGen prompts for the pretrained\\nmodels. Thanks to instruction fine-tuning, fine-tunedLlama 2-Chatmodels of all sizes show an\\neffectively zero percentage of toxic model generations, and hence their results are not presented here.\\n• Bias. Tables 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50 present the distribution of sentiment scores across different\\ndemographic groups under the domains of race, gender, religious ideology, political ideology, and\\nprofession. Overall, we observe positive sentiment scores for each domain in the BOLD dataset for\\n¶¶curie:ft-personal-2023-06-01-06-02-42 isusedfor“truthful\",and curie:ft-personal-2023-06-01-05-20-23\\nis used for “informative\".\\n∗∗∗In this analysis, we remove prompts that fall into the religious ideology subgroups Hinduism and Atheism, because\\nthey are underrepresented with only 12 and 29 prompts, respectively.\\n69'),\n",

Promote or enable dangerous behaviors to the user or other people.\\n3. Contain, promote or enable offensive and abusive behavior towards the user or other people.\\n4.

For this process, a team of highly skilled content managers manually reviewed the annotations\\nand approved the ones that would be used.\\nDuring the quality assurance step, reviewers were asked to only approve those annotations that matched our\\nguidelines: (a) they are consistent with the dialogue history, (b) follow instructions in the prompt (c) are\\nfree of grammatical, spelling and other writing errors, and (d) do not fall into any of the categories described\\nin Section A.5.2. If an annotation needed small changes to be approved, due to grammar or spelling mistakes,\\nor to improve the structure, cohesiveness and style of the text, reviewers could edit it to fix the issues and\\napprove it. If the answer could not be approved without major changes, the reviewers were asked to reject it\\nand write the feedback necessary to improve it.\\nA.5.4 Annotator Selection\\nTo select the annotators who could work on our different data collection tasks, we conducted a multi-step\\nassessment process where we tested their understanding of our guidelines, the alignment with our quality\\nassessment criteria, the alignment with our sensitive topics guidelines and their reading and writing skills.\\nThe process included 4 tests:\\n• Thefirsttestconsistsof3sectionsoftestingtoevaluategrammar,readingcomprehensionandwriting\\nstyle.

This was a deliberately\\nconservative approach in order to produce a “clean” subset of the data with high precision, and is used in\\nopen-sourced evaluation libraries (e.g. Gao et al. (2021)).\\nThis approach, however, was unable to detect precisely what proportion of a given sample is contaminated,\\nand didn’t take into account how evaluation datasets are constructed. Furthermore, as noted in Chowdhery\\net al. (2022), some datasets (such as BoolQ) contain contexts extracted verbatim from the web, but not the\\nquestion and answer continuation. As such, highly contaminated samples from these datasets are unlikely\\nto gain an unfair advantage. The methodology in Chowdhery et al. (2022) further improves on the earlier\\nn-gram collision detection by considering a sample to be contaminated if 70% of all 8-grams can be found at\\nleast once in the training data.\\nThe previous methodologies noted above all consider contamination in text space, and don’t appear to\\nconsider the formatting of prompts used for actual evaluation. In contrast, we instead match on tokenized\\ninput, being careful to pass fully verbalized evaluation samples to the tokenizer. We also diverge from the\\nprevious methodologies by considering contamination from a bottom-up perspective. We consider a token\\nto be contaminated if it appears in any tokenn-gram longer than 10 tokens in both the evaluation sample\\nand the training set, and define the contamination percentage of a sample to be the percentage of tokens\\ncontaminated. Thisallowsustoviewthebenchmarkperformanceofourmodelsonarangeofcontamination\\nscales, while retaining the ability to test a high-precision clean subset (samples with< 20% contamination)\\nand a high-precision contaminated subset (samples with> 80% contamination). In order to account for the\\nvagaries of the precise format of verbalized samples, we allow a small \"skipgram budget\" of four tokens, so\\nthat matched spans between an evaluation sample and the training data can differ in at most four positions\\n(we do not allow trailing mismatches, or mismatches in the first 10 tokens).\\nWe identify such 10(+)-skipgrams with suffix arrays implemented using a variation of the library from Lee\\net al. (2022), modified to work on a PySpark cluster (effectively without random access to disk). Given the\\nembarrassingly parallel nature of the task, we are able to find all such 10-grams (and their full lengths) in\\nour entire dataset in around seven hours (including time to tokenize), utilizing an estimated 1,500 cores.\\nAs there are many confounding factors at play when determining whether dataset contamination has\\ncontributed to evaluation performance (mostly stemming from the fact that \"clean\" and \"dirty\" subsets do\\nnot necessarily well-estimate the population distribution), we make the following assumption: In the event\\nof dataset contamination contributing to evaluation performance, we expect both the \"cleanest\" examples to\\nhave an overallworseaverage score than their complement, and the \"dirtiest\" samples to have an overallbetter\\naverage score than their complement. It is insufficient evidence for contamination if only one of these were\\ntrue. To this end, we define four (non-disjoint) subset types as follows:\\n• “Clean”samples, with less than 20% token contamination,\\n• “Not clean”samples, with greater than (or equal to) 20% token contamination,\\n• “Not dirty”samples, with less than 80% token contamination,\\n• “Dirty” samples, with greater than (or equal to) 80% token contamination.\\nThere is an additional confounding factor that we attempt to address directly. With the given definition of\\ncontamination (as well as other definitions mentioned in the literature), there is a possibility that a sample\\n75'),\n",

Tuned models\\nare intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted\\nfor a variety of natural language generation tasks.\\nOut-of-Scope UsesUse in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade\\ncompliance laws). Use in languages other than English. Use in any other way\\nthat is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Licensing Agreement for\\nLlama 2.\\nHardware and Software(Section 2.2)\\nTraining Factors We used custom training libraries, Meta’s Research Super Cluster, and produc-\\ntion clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also\\nperformed on third-party cloud compute.\\nCarbon Footprint Pretraining utilized a cumulative 3.3M GPU hours of computation on hardware\\nof type A100-80GB (TDP of 350-400W). Estimated total emissions were 539\\ntCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.\\nTraining Data(Sections 2.1 and 3)\\nOverview Llama 2was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of data from publicly available\\nsources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as\\nwellasoveronemillionnewhuman-annotatedexamples. Neitherthepretraining\\nnor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.\\nData Freshness The pretraining data has a cutoff of September 2022, but some tuning data is\\nmore recent, up to July 2023.\\nEvaluation Results\\nSee evaluations for pretraining (Section 2); fine-tuning (Section 3); and safety (Section 4).\\nEthical Considerations and Limitations(Section 5.2)\\nLlama 2is a new technology that carries risks with use. Testing conducted to date has been in\\nEnglish, and has not covered, nor could it cover all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs,\\nLlama 2’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances\\nproduce inaccurate or objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any\\napplications ofLlama 2, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their\\nspecific applications of the model. Please see the Responsible Use Guide available available at\\nhttps://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-user-guide\\nTable 52: Model card forLlama 2.\\n77')]"
